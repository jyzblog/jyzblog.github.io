# Chapter 1: Being Self-Employed and On Your Own

This chapter introduces the concept of self-employment and its implications, focusing on tax responsibilities and practical considerations for individuals working independently. 

### What Self-Employment Means

Being self-employed means you are **taxed on the net profit** of your business activities for the year, regardless of how much money you have in the bank or reinvest in the business.  As a self-employed individual, you are responsible for tracking your income and expenses to report them accurately at tax time. This differs from being an employee who receives a W-2 form from their employer detailing their income. 

### Legal Consequences of Self-Employment

As a self-employed individual, you face **legal and practical responsibilities**. You are personally liable for business debts unless you form a corporation or LLC. It is essential to obtain appropriate insurance coverage, including liability insurance for claims arising from services and errors and omissions or malpractice insurance for professionals. 

### Practical Issues in Self-Employment

Self-employed individuals need to **manage their own safety net**.  Unlike employees, you are not eligible for unemployment or worker's compensation benefits.  

### Tax Terminology

The chapter emphasizes understanding key tax terms like:

*   **Income**:  Money earned from business activities, regardless of payment method, including cash, checks, credit cards, or electronic transfers.
*   **Losses**: When deductible expenses exceed income, resulting in a tax loss, which may differ from an economic loss due to limitations on deductions.

### Being 1099ed

*   **Form 1099-MISC**: Businesses paying you $600 or more for services during the year are required to issue this form, reporting the income to the IRS.
*   **Consumer Payments**: Individuals (consumers) who are your customers or clients are not required to issue a 1099-MISC. However, you must still report all income received from both businesses and individuals.

# Chapter 2: Getting Set Up for Tax Reporting and Business Operations

This chapter emphasizes the importance of establishing proper systems for recordkeeping, obtaining necessary tax identification, choosing the right accounting methods, and addressing legal requirements like business names, intellectual property protection, and licenses.

### Preliminaries

*   **Separating Business and Personal Finances**:  Open a separate business bank account and obtain a business credit card to track business transactions clearly and avoid confusion with personal expenses.  This separation is **crucial for tax purposes** and helps establish a businesslike approach, particularly when dealing with potential hobby loss claims by the IRS.

### Keeping Books and Records for Tax Reporting

*   **Legal Requirement**: The law mandates businesses to maintain accurate books and records, making them available to the IRS upon request.
*   **Importance for Business Operations**: Good recordkeeping is **essential for monitoring profitability, cash flow, and managing expenses**.
*   **Choosing the Right Accounting System**: Select an accounting system that suits your business needs and provides essential features like generating invoices, tracking income and expenses, and creating financial statements. Options include spreadsheets, accounting software, and cloud-based solutions.
*   **Retaining Receipts**: Keep paper receipts or scanned copies for all business expenses, as they serve as **proof of your expenditures**.

### Business Reasons for Recordkeeping

*   **Profitability Assessment**: Records help you determine whether your business is profitable or not.
*   **Cash Flow Management**: Records provide insights into your cash flow, allowing you to anticipate upcoming expenses and manage your finances effectively.
*   **Loan Applications**:  Lenders often require financial records to assess your creditworthiness when you apply for business loans.
*   **Investor Relations**: If you seek investments, potential investors will want to review your financial records to evaluate your business's performance and potential for growth.

### Tax ID Number 

*   **EIN or Social Security Number**: Depending on your business structure and whether you have employees, you may need a separate Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS or use your Social Security number for tax reporting. 

### Tax Year

*   **Calendar Year vs. Fiscal Year**: Choose a tax year that aligns with your business cycle. Most self-employed individuals use the calendar year (January 1 to December 31), but a fiscal year (any 12-month period) may be more suitable for some businesses. 

### Accounting Method

*   **Cash vs. Accrual**: Select an accounting method that determines how you recognize income and expenses. Most self-employed individuals use the cash method, recognizing income when received and expenses when paid. 
*   **Prepaid Expenses**:  Be aware of the **12-month rule**, which limits the deduction of prepaid expenses to those covering a 12-month period or less. Expenses extending beyond 12 months are deducted proportionally over the covered period. 

### Decide Your Business Name

*   **Fictitious Name**: If using a name other than your personal name, consider registering a "Doing Business As" (DBA) with your local government. 
*   **Name Availability**: Research thoroughly to ensure the chosen name is not already in use by a competitor, locally or nationally. Check online directories, social media platforms, and state filing offices.  

### Whatâ€™s Your IP? 

*   **Intellectual Property (IP)**: Recognize the importance of protecting your intellectual property, which includes:
    *   **Patents**:  Exclusive rights to market inventions, formulas, or processes, obtained through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, often involving significant costs and time. 
    *   **Trademarks**: Distinctive symbols or phrases identifying your business, registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. 
    *   **Copyrights**: Protection for original creative works, like writing, music, or art, obtained through the U.S. Copyright Office, generally straightforward and less expensive than patents. 
    *   **Trade Secrets**: Confidential information about your business practices, protected through non-disclosure agreements and internal security measures.

### Obtain Licenses, Permits, and Permission

*   **Legal Requirements**:  Research and secure all necessary licenses and permits to operate legally, varying by industry, location, and business activities.
*   **Consequences of Non-Compliance**: Failure to obtain required licenses or permits can expose you to penalties, lawsuits, and potentially shut down your business.
*   **Resources**: Consult the Small Business Administration (SBA) website or relevant government agencies for guidance on specific license and permit requirements.

# Chapter 3: Using Schedule C

This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of Schedule C, the tax form used by self-employed individuals operating as sole proprietors to report their business income and expenses on their personal income tax return.

### Tax Filing on Schedule C

*   **Schedule C as Part of Form 1040**: Schedule C is not a standalone filing; it's filed along with your personal income tax return, Form 1040.
*   **Who Files Schedule C?**:  While anyone operating a sole proprietorship files a Schedule C, the largest sectors using this form are professional, scientific, and technical services, followed by other services like personal and laundry services.  Within the "other services" category, healthcare and social assistance are experiencing the most significant growth.  Construction, wholesale, retail, and the performing arts are other sectors that commonly file Schedule C. 
*   **Purpose of Schedule C**: Schedule C provides a detailed picture of your business activities for the tax year, including income earned and expenses incurred.
*   **Schedule C vs. Schedule C-EZ**: Schedule C-EZ is a simplified version for businesses meeting specific criteria, such as having expenses under $5,000, using the cash accounting method, no inventory, only one sole proprietorship, no employees, no home office deduction, and no purchases of machinery or equipment during the year. However, since many self-employed individuals claim the home office deduction, the longer Schedule C is more commonly used.

### Entries on Schedule C

*   **Basic Information**: Before detailing your income and expenses, Schedule C requires basic information about you and your business:
    *   **Name and Address**: Include both your personal and fictitious business names, if applicable.
    *   **Business Code**: This code identifies the type of business activity you are engaged in.
    *   **Accounting Method**: Indicate whether you use the cash or accrual method.
    *   **Material Participation**:  Indicate whether you actively participate in the business.  While this is usually obvious for sole proprietors, there are specific criteria to determine material participation in more complex situations.
    *   **Startup**:  Indicate if this is your first year in business, whether as a startup or after acquiring an existing business. 
    *   **Form 1099-MISC Reporting**: State whether you made payments of $600 or more to other self-employed individuals and whether you filed the required Form 1099-MISC.  For example, if you hire a virtual assistant, you'll need to report payments and file Form 1099-MISC.

*   **Parts of Schedule C**: Schedule C is divided into five parts:
    *   **Part I**:  Reports income, further discussed in Chapter 4. 
    *   **Part II**:  Lists common business expenses.  Chapters 4-7 elaborate on these expenses.
    *   **Part III**:  Used by businesses maintaining inventory, discussed in Chapter 4.
    *   **Part IV**:  For those using a personal vehicle for business purposes, requiring details like mileage, personal use availability, and another vehicle available for personal use.
    *   **Part V**:  Captures deductible expenses not listed in Part II.

*   **Additional Forms**: Based on your specific business activities, you may need to file additional forms with Schedule C:  
    *   **Form 4562, Depreciation and Amortization**: Used when purchasing business equipment, like computers, smartphones, or machinery.
    *   **Form 8829, Expenses for Business Use of Your Home**: Required for claiming the home office deduction.
    *   **Form 3800, General Business Credit**: For claiming business tax credits, covered in Chapter 9.
    *   **Form 4684, Casualties and Thefts**: For reporting uninsured casualty or theft losses impacting business property.
    *   **Form 4797, Sales of Business Property**:  Used when selling business property or when the business use percentage of listed property, like vehicles or computers, drops below 50%.

### When, Where, and How to File

*   **Filing Deadline**: Schedule C is due April 15th, alongside your personal income tax return.  You can request a filing extension to October 15th. 
*   **Filing Location**: You file Schedule C with your personal income tax return, either by mail or electronically. 
*   **E-Filing**: Filing electronically is generally preferred due to several advantages, including increased accuracy, enhanced security and privacy, proof of acceptance, simplified filing process (combining federal and state returns), and faster refunds if applicable. 

# Chapter 4: Reporting Your Income

This chapter explains how to report income earned from self-employment activities for tax purposes. It covers various aspects, including different types of payments, handling income from selling items in addition to services, addressing situations where payments are not received, and understanding how to report losses.

### Payment Types Don't Matter 

The chapter emphasizes that the method of payment, whether **cash, check, credit/debit card, or electronic transfer**, is irrelevant for tax reporting. All income received from business activities must be reported and is taxable.

*   **Cash Intensive Businesses**: The IRS pays close attention to cash-based businesses due to the potential for underreporting income. The IRS utilizes sophisticated techniques to audit businesses suspected of underreporting income. For example, they can analyze purchase records, utility usage, and other factors to determine if the reported income aligns with the business operations. 
*   **Cash Payments of $10,000 or More**: Businesses receiving cash payments exceeding $10,000 are required to file Form 8300, Report of Cash Payments Over $10,000 Received in a Trade or Business, to help prevent money laundering and other illegal activities. Failure to report such transactions can lead to civil and criminal penalties.

### Alternative Payments

*   **Bartering**: Income received through bartering, where goods or services are exchanged for other goods or services, is considered taxable income and must be reported at its fair market value.
*   **Debt Cancellation**: When a debt is canceled or forgiven, it is generally treated as taxable income.  For example, if a creditor forgives a portion of a business loan, this amount must be reported as income.

### Selling Items in Addition to Services

The chapter addresses situations where service businesses also sell items to customers. For small businesses, this can be simplified by treating inventory as materials and supplies. 

*   **Simplified Inventory Reporting**: Small businesses can use the cash method to report sales and treat inventory as materials and supplies, deducting their cost as an expense on Schedule C, rather than going through the complexities of calculating cost of goods sold (COGS). 

### Where to Report Payments

*   **Schedule C**: All business income, including fee income, other income like interest, and sales of goods, is reported on Schedule C.
*   **Other Business Income**: Income from sources other than direct payments for services, such as interest earned on business accounts or loans, is reported on line 6 of Schedule C. Examples of such income include interest on bank accounts, loans to customers, late payment fees, and income from listed property when its business use drops below 50%.

### What to Do about 1099s

The chapter provides guidance on handling Form 1099-MISC, which businesses are required to issue for payments of $600 or more during the year.

*   **Discrepancies**: If you receive a 1099-MISC with incorrect information, you should contact the issuer to request a corrected form. If you haven't received the corrected form by the filing deadline, you can request a filing extension to allow more time for the issuer to rectify the issue. Filing an amended return later with the corrected information is also an option. 

### What to Do When You Don't Get Paid

The chapter acknowledges situations where businesses might not receive payment for services rendered.

*   **Cash Basis Accounting**: Under the cash method of accounting, you cannot deduct bad debts or unpaid receivables because you never reported them as income in the first place.

### Losses

The chapter explains the concept of business losses, both economic and tax losses, and how to address them.

*   **Economic Loss vs. Tax Loss**: An economic loss occurs when expenses exceed revenue in a business. A tax loss refers to the loss reported on your tax return, which might differ from the economic loss due to limitations on certain deductions.
*   **Net Operating Losses (NOLs)**: When deductible business expenses exceed income, it results in a net operating loss (NOL), which can be carried back to previous years or carried forward to offset future income, providing tax benefits. 

# Chapter 5: Writing Off T&E Expenses 

This chapter explains how to deduct travel and entertainment (T&E) expenses for your business, including vehicle expenses, local transportation, meals and entertainment, and gifts.  You must understand both the deduction rules and the recordkeeping requirements to maximize your write-offs.

### Vehicle Expenses

If you use your personal car, van, or truck for business, you can deduct a portion of your vehicle expenses.  The allocation between personal and business use is based on mileage. ****

#### Ways to Calculate Deductions

*   **Actual Expenses:** Track all your vehicle costs (gas, oil, repairs, insurance, depreciation, or lease payments) and deduct the portion related to business driving. ****
*   **Standard Mileage Rate:** Deduct a fixed rate per business mile set by the IRS. The 2013 rate was 56.5 cents per mile. ****

Regardless of the method, you can deduct parking and tolls for business travel.  ****

#### Choosing the Best Method

The best method depends on factors like the vehicle's cost, your business mileage, and your overall tax situation.  Expensive vehicles or high business mileage might favor the actual expense method. ****

#### Special Rules for Certain Vehicles

Heavy SUVs (over 6,000 pounds) are eligible for more generous depreciation deductions, including a potential first-year Section 179 deduction of up to $25,000 and bonus depreciation. ****

#### Recordkeeping 

You must keep detailed records of your business driving to claim vehicle expenses. These records must include: ****

*   Cost of the vehicle and improvements (if using the actual expense method)
*   Mileage for each business use and total miles for the year
*   Date of each business use
*   Business destination
*   Purpose of the trip

#### Strategies for Recordkeeping

To simplify recordkeeping: ****

*   Use smartphone or tablet apps to track mileage.
*   Sample your mileage for a representative period and extrapolate for the entire year.

#### Buy or Lease

From a tax perspective, buying or leasing often makes little difference, as the standard mileage rate can be used for both. ****  However, leasing might offer some advantages for cash flow management.

### Local Transportation

You can deduct costs for taxis, buses, trains, and other local transportation used for business purposes.  **** The same recordkeeping rules for vehicle expenses apply, except for mileage tracking.

### Business Meals and Entertainment

You can generally deduct 50% of the cost of business meals and entertainment.  ****  This applies whether you are dining with a client, vendor, or other business associate.  

#### Entertainment Activities

Deductible entertainment activities include: ****

*   Sporting events
*   Concerts
*   Theater performances
*   Parties
*   Vacations

#### Recordkeeping

For meals and entertainment, keep records of:  ****

*   Each separate expense
*   Date
*   Name and address of the venue
*   Business purpose or benefit gained
*   Nature of the business discussion (for entertainment)

### Travel Expenses

You can deduct travel costs (transportation, lodging, meals, and incidentals) if the primary purpose of the trip is business.  **** You can deduct airfare for a U.S. trip if the trip wouldn't have been taken but for the business reason, even if personal activities are included. ****

#### Part Business, Part Pleasure Trips

For trips with both business and personal components, you can generally deduct the travel costs associated with the business portion. **** If you spend the majority of the trip on business, that supports the primary business purpose. ****

#### Recordkeeping for Business Travel

Maintain records showing: ****

*   The cost of each expense category (travel, lodging, meals, incidentals)
*   Trip dates and number of business days
*   Destination
*   Business purpose

#### Strategies for Recordkeeping

*   Use mobile device apps to track expenses and include required information.
*   Scan receipts to maintain them electronically.

### Business Gifts

You can deduct up to $25 per recipient per year for business gifts.  **** Incidental costs like wrapping and shipping are fully deductible. ****

### Strategies for Saving on T&E Costs

*   **Negotiate Discounts:** Leverage your business volume to negotiate lower rates with hotels, airlines, and car rental agencies.
*   **Use Loyalty Programs:** Accumulate points and miles for free or discounted travel.
*   **Bundle Services:** Combining flights, hotels, and car rentals through travel agencies can save money. 
*   **Embrace Technology:** Online travel booking websites and fare comparison tools can help find the best deals.
*   **Consider Alternatives:** Look into video conferencing or other virtual meeting options to reduce travel costs. 

This chapter helps you navigate the rules and complexities of deducting travel and entertainment expenses for your business. Careful recordkeeping and strategic planning can maximize your deductions and improve your bottom line. 

# Chapter 6: Deducting Office-Related Costs

This chapter focuses on the tax deductions available to self-employed individuals for various office-related expenses.  It examines expenses related to physical office space, such as rent or home office deductions, and covers deductions for supplies, technology, utilities, and insurance.

### Rental Expenses

If you rent an office space outside of your home, the rent is a deductible business expense. When choosing a rental space, consider factors like location, accessibility for clients, and the terms of the lease, including the length of the lease, the amount of rent, and any options for renewal or expansion.

### Home Office Use

If you use part of your home for business, you may be eligible to deduct a portion of your home expenses as a business expense.

#### Qualifying for the Home Office Deduction

To claim the home office deduction, your home office must meet **specific requirements**:

*   **Principal place of business**: It must be your principal place of business, where you conduct significant administrative or management activities. 
*   **Exclusive use**: The space must be used **exclusively for business**, meaning it can't be used for personal purposes. However, there are exceptions for storage of inventory or product samples and for daycare facilities. You don't need an entire room; a clearly defined portion of a room is acceptable.
*   **Regular use**: You must use the space **regularly and continuously** for business.  Occasional or incidental use won't qualify.

#### Figuring the Deduction

There are two ways to calculate your home office deduction:

1.  **Actual expense method**: You calculate a fixed percentage of your total home expenses (rent, utilities, insurance, etc.) based on the percentage of your home used for business. 
    *   **Indirect expenses**: A percentage of shared home costs like mortgage interest, property taxes, insurance, utilities, and repairs. 
    *   **Direct expenses**: Costs directly attributable to the home office, like painting the office space. 
    *   **Depreciation**: If you own your home, you can deduct a portion of your home's depreciation based on the business use percentage, using IRS-provided rates. 
2.  **Simplified method**: You deduct \$5 per square foot of home office space, up to a maximum of 300 square feet, for a maximum deduction of \$1,500. 

    *   **No depreciation**: You cannot claim depreciation under the simplified method.

#### Strategies for the Home Office Deduction

*   **Space limitations**: The simplified method might be disadvantageous if your office space exceeds 300 square feet. 
*   **Profitability**:  If your business is not profitable, the simplified method offers no benefit, as there's no current deduction or carryover for home office expenses. 
*   **Recordkeeping**: The actual expense method may be more beneficial but requires meticulous recordkeeping throughout the year.

#### Deduction Limitation

The home office deduction, regardless of the method used, cannot exceed the gross income generated from the business activities conducted in the home office.  If your gross income is less than your total business expenses, your deduction for some home office expenses will be limited. 

#### Additional Home Office Deduction Strategies

*   **Photographic evidence**: To prove business use, take photos of your home office space, especially if you might move before an IRS audit. 
*   **Seek expert advice**:  Consult a tax expert if you're unsure about qualifying for the deduction or which method is best for your situation. 

### Materials and Supplies

The cost of materials and supplies used in your business is generally fully deductible. Avoid overbuying supplies to prevent storage issues, obsolescence, and tying up capital. To maximize tax deductions, purchase only the supplies you anticipate using within the year.  

### Furniture and Fixtures

You have a few options for deducting the cost of furniture and fixtures for your office:

*   **First-year (Section 179) expensing deduction**: This allows you to deduct the entire cost of qualifying property in the year it's placed in service, subject to certain limitations.  It's advantageous for both new and used items and provides a cash flow benefit even if you finance the purchase. 
*   **Bonus depreciation**: Allows for an additional first-year deduction of 50% of the cost of qualifying property, on top of any Section 179 deduction or regular depreciation claimed. This frontloads deductions but doesn't change the total deduction over the item's life. 
*   **Regular depreciation**: If you don't fully expense the cost upfront, you can depreciate the remaining cost over a set period. Furniture and fixtures generally fall under seven-year property for depreciation purposes. 

### Computer-Related Costs

The cost of computers and other technology used in your business can be deducted through the methods outlined for furniture and fixtures.  This includes hardware, software, and internet service. Data backup and IT maintenance and repair costs are also deductible. 

### Insurance

Premiums for various types of insurance related to your business are deductible. This includes:

*   **General liability insurance**: Covers claims for bodily injury or property damage caused by your business operations. 
*   **Professional liability insurance**: Protects against claims arising from errors or omissions in your professional services. 
*   **Business owner's policy (BOP)**: Combines general liability, property insurance, and business interruption coverage. 

### Utilities

The cost of utilities used in your office space is deductible, including electricity, gas, water, and internet service. When claiming the home office deduction, a percentage of your home utility costs is deductible. 

### Miscellaneous Office-Related Costs

Several other miscellaneous office-related costs are deductible, including:

*   **Aquarium and maintenance**: If you have an aquarium in your office, the cost of the aquarium and its ongoing maintenance are deductible. 
*   **Books**: Business-related books with a useful life of one year or less are fully deductible. Books with a longer lifespan can be expensed or depreciated. 
*   **Cleaning supplies**:  Fully deductible.
*   **Postage**:  Fully deductible. 
*   **Bank fees**: Deductible business expenses. 

# Chapter 7: Claiming Deductions A to Z

This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of various tax deductions available to self-employed individuals. It emphasizes the importance of understanding deduction rules, limitations, timing considerations, and recordkeeping requirements. The chapter also highlights the distinction between deductions and tax credits, with the latter being covered in Chapter 9.

### General Deduction Principles

The guiding principle for business deductions is that expenses must be **"ordinary and necessary."** An ordinary expense is customary and accepted in your industry, while a necessary expense is considered helpful and appropriate for your business.

Most deductible expenses have designated lines on Schedule C. If an expenditure doesn't fit into a specific category, it can be reported under "other expenses" in Part V of Schedule C.

The chapter concludes with a **checklist of nondeductible expenses** to help self-employed individuals avoid common pitfalls.

### Specific Deductible Expenses

The chapter provides a detailed explanation of various deductible expenses, including:

*   **Advertising Costs**: Most advertising and promotional expenses are fully deductible in the year they are paid. This includes online advertising, print media, promotional items, and other marketing efforts.

*   **Bad Debts**: There are two types of bad debts, each with distinct tax treatment:
    *   **Business Bad Debts**: Arise from unpaid receivables or loans related to your business. As a cash-basis taxpayer, you generally cannot deduct unpaid receivables because you haven't reported them as income.
    *   **Nonbusiness Bad Debts**:  Arise from personal loans or other non-business related transactions. These are treated as short-term capital losses, subject to limitations on capital loss deductions.

*   **Banking Fees**: Fees charged by banks for services related to your business accounts are deductible. Examples include monthly maintenance fees, transaction fees, and overdraft charges.

*   **Casualty and Theft Losses**:  You can fully deduct casualty and theft losses related to your business that are not covered by insurance. This is in contrast to personal casualty and theft losses, which are subject to limitations.  Documentation like photos, police reports, and insurance claim records should be retained.

*   **Charitable Contributions**: While charitable contributions made by your business are not deductible on Schedule C, you can claim them as an itemized deduction on your personal tax return (Schedule A).

*   **Dues**: Membership dues for professional organizations and business associations related to your industry are deductible. However, dues for social or hobby clubs are not deductible.

*   **Education Expenses**: You can deduct education expenses that maintain or improve skills required for your business. This includes tuition, fees, books, supplies, and travel expenses related to eligible courses or programs. 

*   **Impairment-Related Expenses**: Individuals with disabilities can deduct expenses necessary for them to work, like attendant care or specialized equipment.

*   **Interest**: Interest paid on business loans, credit cards, or other business debt is deductible.  Ensure proper documentation for loans from family or friends to demonstrate a legitimate debtor-creditor relationship.

*   **Legal and Professional Fees**: Fees for legal, accounting, consulting, or other professional services directly related to your business are deductible. 

*   **Licenses and Regulatory Fees**: Costs associated with obtaining and renewing licenses and permits required to operate your business are deductible.

*   **Materials and Supplies**: Deductible expenses include office supplies, cleaning supplies, and items sold to customers as part of services rendered. For qualified small businesses, inventory can be treated as materials and supplies, simplifying accounting.

*   **Moving Expenses**: Moving expenses related to relocating your home for business reasons can be deducted on your personal tax return if certain distance and time requirements are met.

*   **Payments for Outsourced Workers**: Payments to independent contractors or freelancers for services performed for your business are deductible. Ensure proper worker classification to avoid potential tax liabilities for misclassifying employees as independent contractors. 

*   **Penalties, Fines, and Damages**:  Generally, penalties, fines, or damages paid for violating laws or breaching contracts are not deductible. However, there may be exceptions for certain types of fines or penalties. 

*   **Repayment of Income**:  If you have to repay income previously received and reported, you can generally deduct the repayment in the year it is made.

*   **Startup Costs**:  Costs incurred before you officially begin business operations are generally considered startup costs. These costs are subject to specific deduction rules and limitations. 

*   **Subscriptions**: Subscription fees for business-related publications, journals, or online services are deductible.  If a subscription covers a period extending beyond 12 months, the deduction is spread over the covered period. 

*   **Taxes**: You can deduct certain federal, state, local, and foreign taxes that are directly attributable to your business. However, federal income tax is not deductible on Schedule C.

*   **Utilities**: Costs for utilities used in your business, including electricity, gas, water, internet, and phone services, are deductible.

### Checklist of Nondeductible Expenses

The chapter concludes with a list of common nondeductible expenses, including:

*   **Personal Expenses**:  Costs for personal living, family needs, or hobbies are not deductible.

*   **Political Contributions**:  Contributions to political campaigns or candidates are not deductible.

*   **Tax Penalties**:  Penalties imposed for late filing, late payment, or other tax violations are not deductible.

*   **Illegal Activities**:  Expenses incurred in connection with illegal activities are not deductible.

*   **Lobbying Expenses**: Costs associated with influencing legislation are generally not deductible, though there may be exceptions for certain types of lobbying.

# Chapter 8: Protecting Yourself with Medical Coverage and Retirement Savings

This chapter focuses on two essential aspects of financial security for self-employed individuals:  health insurance and retirement savings. It outlines options, tax implications, and strategies for securing these crucial safety nets.

### Medical Insurance

*   **Individual Mandate**: Starting in 2014, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires most individuals to have health insurance or face a penalty. The chapter explains that minimum essential coverage includes various options, including employer-sponsored plans, individual market plans, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and certain veterans' health coverage.
*   **Exemptions**:  Certain individuals are exempt from the individual mandate, such as those with financial hardships or religious objections.
*   **Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)**: For those with high-deductible health plans (HDHPs), HSAs offer a tax-advantaged way to save for healthcare expenses.  HDHPs have minimum deductibles and out-of-pocket limits, and HSAs allow tax-deductible contributions and tax-free withdrawals for qualified medical expenses. The chapter provides details on HDHP amounts and HSA contribution limits for 2013 and 2014.

### Tax Deduction for Health Coverage

*   **Self-Employed Individuals**: You can deduct the cost of health insurance premiums for yourself, your spouse, and dependents as an adjustment to income on Form 1040. This deduction helps reduce your taxable income, ultimately lowering your tax liability.

### Retirement Savings

*   **Importance**: The chapter emphasizes the significance of retirement savings, particularly for self-employed individuals who don't have employer-sponsored retirement plans. It highlights the need to start saving early and consistently to build a secure financial future.

### SEPs

*   **Simplified Employee Pension (SEP)**: SEPs offer a straightforward way for self-employed individuals to save for retirement. Contributions to a SEP are tax-deductible, and earnings grow tax-deferred until retirement.
*   **Contribution Limit**: The annual deductible contribution limit for self-employed individuals is 20% of net adjusted self-employment income, up to a maximum dollar limit (e.g., $51,000 in 2013). This limit can change annually, so checking the current limit is essential for planning purposes.
*   **Flexibility**: SEPs allow you to adjust your contribution amount annually based on your business's profitability and personal financial situation.

### Solo 401(k)s

*   **Solo 401(k)**: Another retirement plan option for self-employed individuals and small business owners with no employees (other than a spouse). 
*   **Dual Contributions**: A Solo 401(k) allows contributions as both an "employee" and an "employer." You can contribute both as a percentage of your self-employment income (employee contribution) and as a percentage of your business profits (employer contribution), subject to overall limits. This dual contribution feature can help maximize your retirement savings.

### Other Retirement Savings Options

*   **Traditional and Roth IRAs**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 
*   **Contribution Limits**:  IRAs have annual contribution limits (e.g., $5,500 in 2013, with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution for those age 50 or older). The sources you provided don't mention whether these limits are the same for 2014 or if they are subject to change, so it's best to check current IRS guidelines for the most up-to-date information.

### Planning for Retirement

*   **Goal Setting**: The chapter encourages setting clear retirement goals and developing a savings plan that aligns with those goals.  This may involve working with a financial advisor to develop a personalized retirement plan.
*   **Investment Strategy**:  To optimize retirement savings, a sound investment strategy is essential. Factors to consider include risk tolerance, diversification, and asset allocation.
*   **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**: It is important to be aware of RMD rules that apply to traditional IRAs and 401(k)s, requiring withdrawals to begin at a certain age. The provided sources do not delve into the specifics of RMD rules, so consulting IRS publications or a financial advisor would be helpful for those nearing retirement.

# Chapter 9: Taking Tax Credits

This chapter explains tax credits, which directly reduce a taxpayer's tax liability, and differentiates between business-related credits and personal credits that arise from business activity.  The chapter emphasizes that all credits, whether business or personal, ultimately offset personal taxes for self-employed individuals.

### Business-Related Tax Credit

*   **General Business Credit**: Many business tax credits are subject to a limitation known as the general business credit.  This limitation, calculated on Form 3800, caps the total amount of business credits that can be claimed in a given year.  The general business credit is calculated as the net tax liability (regular tax minus certain personal credits) reduced by the greater of 25% of regular tax liability exceeding $25,000 or the tentative minimum tax for the year.
*   **Carryforward**:  If the general business credit exceeds the limitation, the unused portion can be carried forward for up to 20 years to offset future tax liabilities.
*   **Types of Business Credits**: The chapter provides a brief overview of several business-related tax credits, acknowledging that these might not be immediately relevant to self-employed individuals without employees.  However, it suggests that understanding these credits can be beneficial for future planning as business circumstances evolve.
    *   **Research Credit**: This credit encourages businesses to invest in research and development activities.  It's available for expenses related to developing new or improved products, processes, or software.  The credit calculation is complex, but it generally allows businesses to deduct a portion of their qualified research expenses.
    *   **Disabled Access Credit**:  Small businesses can claim this credit for expenses incurred to make their facilities more accessible to individuals with disabilities.  Eligible expenses include those related to removing architectural barriers, providing accessible restrooms, and installing ramps or elevators.  The credit amount is 50% of eligible expenses exceeding $250, up to a maximum credit of $5,000.

### Personal Credits Arising from Business

The chapter then shifts to personal tax credits that are available to self-employed individuals as a result of their work.

*   **Dependent Care Credit**:  This credit helps offset the costs of caring for dependents, allowing taxpayers to work.  It's available for expenses related to the care of children under 13, a disabled spouse, or a disabled child of any age. The credit amount is a percentage of eligible expenses, based on the taxpayer's adjusted gross income, up to $3,000 for one dependent or $6,000 for two or more dependents.
*   **Education Credits**: The chapter introduces two education tax credits that can benefit self-employed individuals:
    *   **American Opportunity Credit**:  This credit is available for the first four years of post-secondary education.  It covers 100% of the first $2,000 in educational expenses and 25% of the next $2,000, resulting in a maximum annual credit of $2,500 per eligible student.  There are income limitations to qualify for the full credit, with a phase-out range for higher incomes.
    *   **Lifetime Learning Credit**:  This credit is available for any year of post-secondary education, including graduate school.  It covers 20% of the first $10,000 in educational expenses, up to a maximum credit of $2,000 per tax return.  Similar to the American Opportunity Credit, income limitations apply.
*   **Earned Income Credit**: The earned income credit is a refundable credit designed to assist low- and moderate-income working individuals and families.  Self-employed individuals may qualify for this credit based on their earned income and adjusted gross income. The credit amount varies depending on the taxpayer's filing status, number of qualifying children, and income level.

# Chapter 10: Paying Your Taxes

This chapter discusses the various taxes self-employed individuals are responsible for, going beyond just income tax. It covers self-employment tax, additional Medicare taxes, estimated taxes, and sales taxes.

### Self-Employment Tax

*   **Purpose**: Self-employed individuals are required to pay self-employment tax to fund Social Security and Medicare. This is similar to the taxes withheld from employee wages for these programs.
*   **Calculation**: Self-employment tax consists of two parts: 12.4% for Social Security on income up to a certain limit and 2.9% for Medicare on all earned income. For 2013, the Social Security tax applies to the first $113,700 of self-employment income.
*   **Deductibility**: You can deduct half of the self-employment tax you pay on your personal income tax return to reduce your overall tax liability.
*   **Schedule SE**: Self-employment tax is calculated on Schedule SE, which accompanies your Form 1040.
*   **Optional Method for Farmers**:  Farmers have the option to use an alternative method to calculate their self-employment tax if their gross income from farming is relatively low.

### Additional Medicare Tax on Earned Income

*   **Purpose**: An additional Medicare tax of 0.9% applies to earned income above certain thresholds, starting in 2013.
*   **Thresholds**: The threshold for the additional Medicare tax varies depending on your filing status. For example, in 2013, the threshold for single filers is $200,000.
*   **Calculation**: The additional Medicare tax is calculated only on the portion of your income that exceeds the threshold.

### Additional Medicare Tax on Net Investment Income

*   **Purpose**: A 3.8% Medicare surtax is imposed on net investment income for individuals with income above certain thresholds. This tax is not directly related to self-employment income, but self-employed individuals with high investment income may be subject to it.

### Estimated Taxes

*   **Purpose**: Since self-employed individuals don't have taxes withheld from their income, they are required to pay estimated taxes throughout the year to cover their tax liability.
*   **Calculation**: Estimated taxes are based on your projected income and deductions for the year.
*   **Payment Schedule**: Estimated taxes are typically paid in four installments: April 15th, June 15th, September 15th, and January 15th of the following year.
*   **Penalties**: Failure to pay sufficient estimated taxes can result in penalties.
*   **Strategies**: The chapter suggests strategies for managing estimated tax payments, such as setting up a separate bank account to accumulate funds for tax payments and adjusting withholding from other income sources to avoid overpayment.

### Sales Taxes

*   **Applicability**: Most states impose sales taxes, and self-employed individuals selling taxable goods or services are responsible for collecting and remitting these taxes to the state.
*   **Responsibilities**: Self-employed individuals act as tax collectors for sales taxes, adding the tax to the sale price and periodically remitting it to the state.
*   **Variations**: Sales tax rates and rules vary by state, so it's important to understand the specific requirements in your state.

# Chapter 11: Strategizing Year-Round for Tax Savings

This chapter emphasizes the importance of considering tax implications throughout the year, not just during tax season, to maximize savings. It presents various strategies for making tax-savvy business decisions, engaging in year-end planning, understanding post-year tax elections, and audit-proofing your tax return.

### Tax-Savvy Business Decisions

The chapter highlights that actions taken throughout the year can significantly impact your tax liability, potentially offering savings, improving cash flow, and helping achieve business objectives. 

*   **Set Up a Qualified Retirement Plan**: Establishing and contributing to a qualified retirement plan, like a SEP or Solo 401(k), offers tax benefits by sheltering business profits from immediate taxation and simultaneously builds a retirement nest egg.

*   **Take a Disaster Loss on the Prior Year's Return**:  If your business suffers a casualty loss due to a federally declared disaster and you haven't received insurance or other reimbursements, you can claim the loss on the previous year's tax return. This can result in an immediate tax refund, providing funds for replacing property or supporting business continuity.

*   **Stay Current on Tax Developments**:  Staying informed about changes in tax laws and how they affect your business is crucial. Resources like websites, publications, and tax professionals can help stay updated.

*   **Change Your Business Structure**:  As your business grows, your needs may evolve. You might need to consider changing your legal structure, such as transitioning from a sole proprietorship to a different entity like an LLC or corporation. This can offer tax advantages, limit personal liability, or improve access to investments.

### Year-End Planning

The chapter underscores the importance of year-end tax planning, particularly for cash-basis businesses. The common strategy is to defer income and accelerate deductions to minimize tax liability for the current year.

*   **Postponing Income**: Deferring income can be beneficial if your current tax bracket is higher than expected in future years or if you anticipate reaching income thresholds that trigger additional taxes. Strategies for postponing income include delaying invoicing, negotiating payment terms, and deferring the completion of projects. 

*   **Accelerating Deductions**: Accelerating deductions can reduce your taxable income for the current year. Tactics include prepaying expenses like subscriptions, insurance, and rent (within certain limitations), stocking up on supplies, and contributing to a Health Savings Account (HSA) if eligible.

### Post-Year Tax Elections

This section discusses tax elections you can make after the tax year has ended, allowing flexibility in optimizing your tax position.

*   **Optimize Write-offs for Equipment Purchases**:  You have choices regarding deducting the cost of business equipment. You can opt for immediate expensing through the Section 179 deduction or utilize bonus depreciation for upfront write-offs. Alternatively, you can spread deductions over multiple years through regular depreciation if that is more advantageous for your tax situation. 

*   **Retirement Plan Contributions**:  You can set up and fund a traditional or Roth IRA until the tax filing deadline, even with a filing extension.  You can also make contributions to a SEP until October 15th of the following year.

### Lease Instead of Buy?

The chapter mentions leasing as an alternative to buying business equipment or property. Leasing can offer certain tax advantages and financial flexibility, especially for equipment that becomes obsolete quickly.

### Don't Overlook Carryovers

Carryovers represent deductions or credits from previous years that were not fully utilized due to limitations in tax laws. Keeping track of carryovers is important to ensure you take advantage of these tax benefits in subsequent years. Common carryovers include home office deductions, net operating losses (NOLs), and charitable contribution deductions.

### Audit-Proof Your Return

While a completely audit-proof return might be an ideal, this section emphasizes the importance of minimizing audit risk and safeguarding against potential scrutiny from the IRS. 

*   **Correct Worker Classification**: Properly classifying workers as employees or independent contractors is crucial to avoid significant tax penalties. Misclassification can lead to back taxes, penalties, and interest.  

*   **Maintain Meticulous Records**: Maintaining accurate and detailed records for all business income and expenses is paramount to support your deductions and credits if your return is audited. Pay close attention to recordkeeping requirements for areas prone to audit scrutiny, such as travel and entertainment expenses and charitable contributions.

*   **Adhere to Deduction and Credit Limitations**: While claiming all allowable deductions is encouraged, ensure you comply with any limitations on deductions and credits. Exceeding those limitations can raise red flags with the IRS.

*   **Provide All Required Information**: Ensure your tax return includes all necessary information and that all required forms and schedules are complete and attached. Incomplete returns can trigger IRS inquiries or processing delays.

*   **Timely Filing**: File your return on time or request an extension using Form 4868 if needed to avoid penalties for late filing.

The chapter also cautions against actions that might increase audit risk, such as misreporting income or claiming a disproportionately high amount of deductions relative to income.

# Chapter 12: Strategies as Your Business Grows

This chapter focuses on strategies for handling the growth of your business, including moving to larger quarters, hiring employees, changing your business structure, and eventually selling the business. The sources provide insights and guidance on navigating these transitions successfully.

### Moving to Larger Quarters

*   As your business expands, you may **outgrow your current workspace** and need to move to larger quarters. This could involve **renting a bigger office space, purchasing a commercial property, or expanding your home office**.
*   When considering a move, it's essential to **assess your current and future needs** carefully. Factors to consider include the **size of your team, storage requirements, client meeting areas, and any specialized equipment or facilities** you may require.
*   The sources highlight the importance of **understanding the terms and conditions of leases** when renting commercial property. **Lease agreements are binding contracts, and breaking a lease prematurely can result in financial penalties.**
*   Strategies for **getting out of an existing lease** include:
    *   **Looking for escape clauses** in the lease agreement, such as an early termination clause.
    *   **Negotiating with the landlord** to release you from the lease or find a suitable replacement tenant.
    *   **Subletting the space** to another business, if permitted by the lease agreement.

### Hiring Employees

*   As your business grows, you might reach a point where you need to **hire employees to manage the workload and support further expansion**.
*   **Hiring employees** brings both **benefits and challenges**. It can **free up your time to focus on strategic initiatives** and allow for **increased productivity and specialization**. However, it also introduces **responsibilities related to payroll, taxes, employee benefits, and legal compliance.**
*   **Key employer responsibilities**:
    *   **Payroll and Taxes**: Accurate calculation and timely remittance of payroll taxes, including federal and state income taxes, Social Security, and Medicare taxes.
    *   **Employee Benefits**: Providing benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off, as required by law or company policy.
    *   **Legal Compliance**: Adhering to labor laws related to wages, hours, working conditions, discrimination, harassment, and workplace safety.
    *   **Practical Considerations**: Establishing clear policies and procedures, providing training and mentorship, and fostering a positive and productive work environment.

### Changing Legal Status

*   As your business evolves, you may consider **changing its legal structure** to better suit your needs. This could involve **transitioning from a sole proprietorship to a partnership, limited liability company (LLC), S corporation, or C corporation**.
*   The choice of business structure impacts various aspects, including **liability, taxation, and administrative requirements**.
*   Factors to consider when deciding on a business structure:
    *   **Liability Protection**: LLCs and corporations offer limited liability, shielding personal assets from business debts and lawsuits.
    *   **Taxation**: Different structures have varying tax implications. S corporations and LLCs allow for pass-through taxation, while C corporations are subject to double taxation.
    *   **Administrative Burden**: Corporations have more complex compliance requirements, including annual meetings, recordkeeping, and reporting.
    *   **Access to Capital**: Corporations, especially C corporations, have more options for raising capital through equity financing.
    *   **Exit Strategy**: The business structure can impact options for selling the business or transferring ownership.

### Selling the Business

*   Eventually, you may decide to **sell your business**, either for **retirement, to pursue other opportunities, or due to market conditions**.
*   Selling a business involves several steps, including **valuing the business, finding potential buyers, negotiating terms, and completing the legal transfer of ownership**. 
*   The sources don't offer specific guidance on selling a business, but highlight the importance of having a **clear exit strategy** in place. This involves **considering your long-term goals and how the business structure and operations align with your exit plans**.
