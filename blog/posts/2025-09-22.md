# Workout Plan

## Warm-up Stretches (10 minutes)
Before starting your workout, it's important to properly warm up your muscles to prevent injury and improve your performance. Here are some stretches you can do to prepare your body:
1. Hip Flexor Stretch - Kneel on one knee and place your other foot flat on the ground. Lean forward until you feel a stretch in the hip of your back leg. Hold for 15-30 seconds and switch sides.
2. Shoulder Dislocations - Hold a broomstick with both hands, and slowly lift it over your head and behind your back. Reverse the motion and repeat for 10-15 reps.
3. Spiderman Lunge - Step forward with one leg and place your hands on the ground inside your foot. Straighten your back leg and hold for 15-30 seconds. Switch sides and repeat.
4. Cat-Camel - Start on your hands and knees, and alternate between arching your back and rounding it, moving slowly and smoothly.
5. Leg Swings - Stand facing a wall or support, and swing one leg back and forth, trying to increase the range of motion with each swing. Switch sides and repeat.
6. Squat to Stand - From a standing position, bend your knees and squat down, placing your hands on the ground. Straighten your legs and lift your hips up, reaching for the ceiling. Repeat for 10-15 reps.
