# Chapter 1: History

### Early Efforts to Protect Land

* People have been trying to protect land for centuries.
* **One of the earliest examples of land protection comes from the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1636, which set aside 6,000 acres of forest to be held in common by six towns.**
* This effort aimed to ensure a sustained supply of timber and fuel.
* However, the sources note that this act was not primarily motivated by conservation.
* It arose from practical considerations of resource management.

### Charles Eliot and the Trustees of Reservations

* The sources highlight Charles Eliot, a landscape architect, and his contributions to land protection.
* **In 1890, Eliot proposed the creation of a private organization to hold scenic and historic lands for public enjoyment.**
* This led to the founding of the Trustees of Reservations in Massachusetts in 1891, which is considered the first modern land trust in the United States.
* **The Trustees' initial focus was on protecting scenic and historic sites, with an emphasis on public access and recreation.**
* The sources explain that Eliot's vision was shaped by his belief in the importance of public access to natural beauty and the role of private organizations in conservation efforts.

### John Muir and the Sierra Club

* The Sierra Club, founded in 1892 by John Muir, is another key player in the history of land conservation.
* **The Sierra Club's early efforts focused on protecting large areas of wilderness, particularly in the Sierra Nevada mountains.**
* **Muir, a renowned naturalist and writer, advocated for the preservation of wilderness for its own sake, emphasizing its spiritual and aesthetic value.**
* The sources explain that Muir's views contrasted with the utilitarian approach of conservationists like Gifford Pinchot, who believed in managing natural resources for human benefit.

### The Hetch Hetchy Controversy

* The sources explain that the Hetch Hetchy controversy of the early 20th century exemplified the tension between preservationist and utilitarian approaches to conservation.
* San Francisco sought to dam the Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park to create a water reservoir.
* **Muir and the Sierra Club fiercely opposed the dam, arguing that it would destroy a place of exceptional natural beauty and violate the sanctity of national parks.**
* Despite their efforts, Congress approved the dam in 1913.
* The sources note that the Hetch Hetchy controversy remains a significant event in conservation history, highlighting the ongoing debate over the balance between human needs and the preservation of wild places.

### Expanding the Land Trust Movement

* The sources describe how the land trust movement continued to expand in the 20th century.
* **The Save-the-Redwoods League, founded in 1918, aimed to protect California's iconic redwood forests through land acquisition.**
* **The Nature Conservancy, established in 1951, initially focused on preserving natural areas for scientific research but later broadened its scope to include biodiversity conservation on a larger scale.**
* **The rise of urban sprawl in the postwar era, fueled by government policies and suburban development, further motivated land conservation efforts.**
* The sources explain that as more people recognized the threats posed by sprawl, the land trust movement gained momentum.

### The Evolution of Land Conservation Strategies

* **Over time, land trusts developed various strategies for protecting land, including outright purchase, conservation easements, and partnerships with government agencies.**
* **Conservation easements, which allow landowners to restrict development on their property while retaining ownership, became increasingly popular in the latter half of the 20th century.**
* The sources note that land trusts also began to focus on broader conservation goals, such as protecting biodiversity, ecosystem services, and working lands.
* **By the end of the 20th century, the land trust movement had become a major force in land conservation, with thousands of organizations operating across the United States.**
* The sources emphasize that the history of land conservation is one of evolving strategies, philosophies, and challenges, with land trusts playing a central role in protecting America's natural and cultural heritage.

# Chapter 2: Sprawl

### Urban Sprawl

*   Urban sprawl can be defined as **low-density residential development beyond the edge of service and employment areas**. This type of development is **dependent on automobiles**, and it is **associated with negative consequences** for the environment, the economy, and society.
*   The **roots of sprawl can be traced back to the early 20th century**, when cities began to grow rapidly and there was a demand for new housing. The federal government **encouraged sprawl** through programs like the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (1933) and the Federal Housing Administration (1934). These programs **made it easier for people to buy homes in the suburbs** and all but assured urban sprawl and its consequence, inner city decline.
*   **Zoning laws** also contributed to sprawl by **separating residential areas from commercial and industrial areas**. This separation **made it necessary for people to drive** to get to work, shop, and run errands. As a result, the comprehensive approach to zoning has resulted in a complicated structure of zones for various uses, along with rigid specifications. The outcome is that life for most people today requires daily use of a car.

### Consequences of Sprawl

*   Sprawl has a **number of negative consequences**. 
    *   It **destroys natural habitats and agricultural land**, **increases traffic congestion**, **pollutes the air and water**, and **contributes to social isolation**.
    *   Sprawl also **makes it more difficult for people to walk, bike, or take public transportation**.

### Alternatives to Sprawl

*   There are a **number of alternatives to sprawl**, such as **smart growth**, **new urbanism**, and **traditional neighborhood design**. These approaches **emphasize compact, walkable communities** that are well-connected to public transportation.
*   **Land trusts can play a role in combating sprawl** by protecting land from development. They can also work to promote smart growth policies.

### Sprawl and Land Trusts

*   **Sprawl is a major threat to land conservation** as it continues to convert natural areas into subdivisions and strip malls. 
*   Land trusts are working to **protect land from sprawl** by acquiring land, negotiating conservation easements, and working to change land-use policies.


# Chapter 3: Why Save Land?

### Aesthetic Reasons

*   **Natural lands have a beauty, complexity, and variety that touches people in a way nothing else can.** They offer people a chance to connect with nature and appreciate its beauty.

    *   **Example:** A group of students went on a field trip to Mineral Springs bog and learned about its history and ecological significance. They saw it as a living, dynamic ecosystem with a rich history.

        *   The essay mentioned the students pulling their feet out of the ooze, highlighting the sensory experience and the immersive nature of the field trip.

    *   **Example:** Author Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, who wrote about the Florida scrub ecosystem, found solace in the remoteness and beauty of the natural landscape. She believed that people needed distance from the chaos of urban life to truly appreciate nature.
*   **Preserving landscapes, habitats, and species is important for maintaining the diversity and beauty of the world.**
*   **The sensory experiences in natural areas provide a sense of wonder and escape from the monotony of urban life.**

### Practical Reasons

*   **Protecting land is essential for preserving ecosystem services that benefit everyone.** These services include clean water, air purification, flood control, and carbon sequestration.

    *   **Example:** Saving land can lead to lower property taxes because areas with protected land require fewer community services. The presence of open spaces and natural areas reduces the need for expensive infrastructure and services.
*   **Preserving farmland has practical benefits such as food security, local economic growth, and supporting rural communities.**
*   **Donating land or easements can have tax benefits for individuals.**

### Ethical or Moral Reasons

*   **Humans have an ethical obligation to protect the Earth's ecosystems and act as responsible stewards of nature.** This responsibility comes from the understanding that all life on Earth is interconnected and humans have a unique ability to affect the environment.
*   **Philosopher Aldo Leopold developed the idea of a "land ethic," which emphasizes the interconnectedness of humans and nature, advocating for a harmonious relationship between them.**

    *   **John Muir and John Burroughs expressed similar ideas, recognizing the inherent value of nature and the need to respect it.** They questioned the anthropocentric view of nature that focuses solely on human utility.

*   **The concept of stewardship encourages responsible land management to maintain and enhance natural resources for current and future generations.**

    *   **Example:** The stewardship of oak forests might involve prescribed burns and selective cutting to prevent their conversion to a different forest type. This active management is based on ecological principles and aims to maintain the integrity of the oak forest ecosystem.
*   **Religious perspectives often support stewardship, viewing humans as caretakers of God's creation.**

    *   **Example:** The book _Earthkeeping: Christian Stewardship of Natural Resources_ argues that humans have dominion over nature but should use it to serve both nature and humanity.

# **Chapter 4: Who Will Save the Land?**

### Colleges and Universities as Land Stewards

Colleges and universities are often gifted land for preservation. However, history suggests they are not always the most reliable land stewards. They sometimes prioritize financial gain over their responsibility to protect the land. 

**Examples:**

*   **The Ott Preserve**: Calhoun County currently owns the 260-acre Harvey N. Ott Preserve. The land was previously owned by Battle Creek College, who sold off portions for development in the 1930s.
*   **Middlebury College**: Joseph Battell left a large tract of land to Middlebury College with instructions to maintain the forests in their original state. The college sold portions to the U.S. Forest Service, which subsequently developed and logged the land, including a portion that is now the Sugarbush Ski Area.
*   **Mount Kearsarge**: The Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests donated the summit of Mount Kearsarge to the state of New Hampshire to be used as a forestry and recreational reservation. The state later erected numerous public safety telecommunication towers on the summit, impacting the scenic view.

### Biological Diversity: Saving Land Based on Ecological Principles

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Biodiversity Encompasses More Than Just Species**: Losing a unique ecosystem or landscape also represents a loss of biodiversity, even if all the individual species still exist elsewhere. Protecting interacting species within their natural communities is crucial for preserving biodiversity.
*   **Land Trusts and Conservation Rules**: Land trusts can play a significant role in conserving biodiversity by applying ecological principles to their land acquisition strategies.

### Nine Rules for Conservation-Oriented Land Acquisition

The sources lay out nine rules to guide land trusts in maximizing their conservation efforts: 

1.  **Represent Natural Ecosystems**: Focus on protecting representative examples of all major ecosystems within the land trust's service area, even if complete representation proves challenging.
2.  **Have a Vision, Plan, and Protect High-Quality Sites**: Develop a clear vision and plan, prioritizing high-quality sites with intact ecosystems and characteristic species. Utilize scientific knowledge and local expertise to identify and assess potential preserves.
3.  **Preserve the Largest Areas Possible**: Prioritize acquiring larger parcels to support larger populations, minimize edge effects, and provide for the needs of species that require extensive habitats.
4.  **Add Land Around Preserves**: Expand existing preserves by acquiring adjacent land to increase size and buffer against external impacts.
5.  **Some Small Preserves Are Worth Saving**: Recognize the value of small preserves, especially those with unique ecological features, high restoration potential, or educational value.
6.  **Construct Corridors if It's Easy**: Consider creating corridors to connect larger habitat patches, facilitating species movement and genetic exchange, but prioritize practicality and feasibility.
7.  **Consider the Whole Landscape**: Understand how human-modified landscapes interact with natural areas and consider the broader landscape context in land protection decisions.
8.  **Save Rare, Threatened, and Endangered Species**: Prioritize protecting habitats for rare, threatened, and endangered species, but plan for long-term habitat management to ensure their survival.
9.  **Prioritize**: Develop a scoring system to prioritize land acquisitions based on the quality of the land, the deal's feasibility, and the land trust's ability to ensure adequate stewardship.

# Chapter 5: Choosing Land to Save

### Introduction: Saving land and rationales

A land trust's mission to save land, particularly natural lands, necessitates a clear understanding of the underlying reasons for such preservation. These rationales can be categorized into three main areas: aesthetic, practical, and ethical or moral considerations.

### Aesthetic Reasons: Beauty and connection to nature

The aesthetic value of natural lands lies in their intrinsic beauty, providing a source of inspiration, tranquility, and connection to the natural world. May Theilgaard Watts, in her book "Reading the Landscape of America," emphasizes the profound experience of immersing oneself in natural landscapes, likening it to walking on a history book with a "flexible cover". Preserving such landscapes ensures the continuation of these enriching experiences for future generations.

### Practical Reasons: Ecosystem Services and economic benefits

Beyond their aesthetic appeal, natural lands provide vital ecosystem services that are crucial for human well-being. These services include climate moderation, flood prevention, pest control, and water purification, among others. While economists might advocate for exploiting these resources up to a certain limit, a more holistic approach recognizes the inherent value of preserving natural ecosystems in their entirety as a safeguard against potential ecological imbalances.

### Ethical or Moral Reasons: A Land Ethic and Stewardship

Aldo Leopold's concept of a "land ethic" posits that humans should act as responsible members of Earth's ecosystems, acknowledging their interconnectedness with all living things. This ethical framework emphasizes nurturing and preserving nature rather than dominating and exploiting it. Similar sentiments are echoed in the writings of John Muir and John Burroughs, who recognized the limitations of a purely utilitarian view of nature. This ethical perspective underscores the moral imperative to protect natural lands for their intrinsic value and the well-being of all living beings.

**Stewardship**, often cited as a motivation for land protection, aligns with the land ethic by emphasizing responsible management of natural resources. It involves actively engaging in practices like prescribed burns and invasive species control to maintain the health and integrity of ecosystems.

### Conservation Biology and Biodiversity: Guiding Principles for Land Selection

**Conservation biology** provides valuable insights for land trusts to effectively protect biodiversity. Preserving biodiversity encompasses safeguarding not only species from extinction but also the diversity of ecosystems, landscapes, and genes. Land trusts can apply principles from conservation biology to formulate rules for acquiring land that maximizes their conservation impact.

### Conservation Rules for Acquiring Land: Practical Guidelines for Land Trusts

**Rule 1. Protect Intact Ecosystems and Landscapes:**

* Prioritize protecting entire, functioning ecosystems rather than isolated fragments.
* Focus on areas that encompass the essential habitat requirements of key species, including breeding and foraging grounds.
* Example: Protecting a heron colony should include the colony site, the stream or pond where they fish, and the surrounding habitats where they live.

**Rule 2. Vision, Planning, and High-Quality Sites:**

* Develop a clear vision and a comprehensive plan that outlines the conservation priorities for the service area.
* Focus on protecting high-quality sites with intact ecosystems and representative species.
* Utilize existing knowledge from publications, databases, and local experts to identify high-quality sites.
* Conduct thorough on-site assessments to evaluate the ecological integrity of potential acquisitions.

**Rule 3. Prioritize Larger Areas:**

* Larger areas support larger populations, reducing the risk of extinction due to random events.
* Larger habitat blocks are crucial for species that exhibit habitat selection behaviors, such as forest-interior birds.
* Larger areas have less edge, which is beneficial for species that thrive in interior habitats.
* Example: Forest-edge species like song sparrows and indigo buntings have benefited from habitat fragmentation, while forest-interior species like ovenbirds and black-throated blue warblers require large, intact forests.

**Rule 4. Connect Existing Preserves:**

* Acquiring land that connects existing protected areas creates corridors that facilitate species movement and dispersal.
* Collaboration with other conservation organizations can enhance the effectiveness of connectivity efforts.

**Rule 5. Consider Small but Ecologically Significant Preserves:**

* Small preserves can be valuable for protecting unique ecosystems, rare species, or critical habitats.
* They can also serve as educational resources and potential starting points for future land acquisitions.
* Example: Protecting a small, high-quality fen or a site with a rare plant community can be ecologically significant, even if it's relatively small.

**Rule 6. Protect Source Habitats:**

* Source habitats are high-quality areas that produce a surplus of individuals that can disperse to other areas.
* These areas are essential for maintaining viable populations of species.
* Recognizing and prioritizing source habitats is crucial for long-term conservation success.

**Rule 7. Protect Sink Habitats Judiciously:**

* Sink habitats are lower-quality areas that may not support self-sustaining populations but can receive individuals dispersing from source habitats.
* Protecting sink habitats can be beneficial for increasing overall population size and genetic diversity.
* However, it's essential to ensure that protecting sink habitats does not come at the expense of protecting higher-quality source habitats.

**Rule 8. Consider Species Needs When Protecting Endangered Species:**

* Acquire sufficient habitat to support the recovery of endangered species, including potential for expansion or shifts in their range.
* Implement appropriate habitat management practices to maintain suitable conditions for endangered species.
* Example: Protecting an endangered salamander species requires securing not only its current habitat but also considering potential future habitat needs and implementing management practices to mitigate threats.

**Rule 9. Prioritize Acquisitions Based on Land Quality, Deal Quality, and Stewardship Potential:**

* Develop a scoring system to evaluate potential land acquisitions based on:
    * **Quality of the land:** ecological significance, size, connectivity, etc.
    * **Quality of the deal:** clear title, boundaries, access, and willingness of the owner
    * **Stewardship potential:** feasibility of managing the property effectively
* Example: Prioritizing a property with high ecological value, a straightforward acquisition process, and a manageable stewardship plan over a property with lower ecological value, complex ownership issues, and challenging stewardship requirements.

### Weighing Ownership vs. Easements: Balancing Control and Pragmatism

The decision of whether to acquire land outright or pursue conservation easements involves considering factors such as control, stewardship capacity, and financial resources. While outright ownership provides greater control over management, easements can be a more pragmatic approach for protecting larger areas or working lands. Some land trusts prioritize easements to avoid the burden of managing multiple small properties.

# Chapter 6: Stewardship

### Defining Stewardship

Stewardship is the ongoing care and management of land to achieve specific conservation goals. These goals may include:

*   **Maintaining regional biodiversity.** 
*   **Protecting specific habitats or species.**
*   **Restoring degraded land to a healthy state.**

### Stewardship Methods

*   **Undisturbed Land:** Some preserves are best left undisturbed to allow natural processes to take their course. 
*   **Active Management:** Others require active management, such as controlled burns, invasive species removal, or habitat restoration.
*   **Habitat Management for Endangered Species:** Properties harboring endangered species likely require specific habitat management plans to ensure their survival.

### Importance of Planning and Science-Based Management 

*   **Written Management Plans:**  Management procedures for each preserve should be detailed in a written plan, which is regularly reviewed and updated as needed.
*   **Scientific Basis:**  Management plans should be grounded in the best available scientific knowledge and practical experience. 
*   **Collaboration with Experts:** Consulting with ecologists and other experts can help inform management decisions. 

### Stewardship Challenges 

*   **Funding:**  Stewardship can be expensive, requiring resources for labor, materials, and ongoing monitoring. 
*   **Time Commitment:** Active management requires a significant investment of time from staff and volunteers. 
*   **Lack of Expertise:**  Land trusts may lack the necessary expertise to carry out certain management tasks. 
*   **Balancing Needs of Different Species:**  Managing for one species may negatively impact another, creating difficult trade-offs.

###  Community Involvement and Education

*   **Engaging Volunteers:**  Well-publicized workdays can engage volunteers in stewardship activities, fostering a sense of community and providing valuable labor.
*   **Educating the Public:** Stewardship activities provide opportunities to educate the public about the importance of land conservation and the ecological processes at work on preserves.

### Monitoring and Evaluation

*   **Regular Monitoring:**  Regular monitoring of preserves is essential to track changes, assess the effectiveness of management practices, and identify potential threats.
*   **Data Collection:** Collecting quantitative data on species populations, vegetation cover, and other ecological indicators can provide valuable insights for adaptive management.
*   **Evaluation of Stewardship Effectiveness:**  Land trusts should regularly evaluate the effectiveness of their stewardship efforts and make adjustments as needed.

###  Preserve Defense

*   **Legal Challenges:**  Preserves may face legal challenges from neighbors, developers, or government agencies seeking to use the land for other purposes.
*   **Funding for Legal Defense:**  Land trusts should establish a preserve defense fund to cover the costs of legal action, similar to the easement defense fund used to protect conservation easements.
*   **Engaging Neighbors:** Building relationships with owners of adjoining properties can help enlist their support and vigilance in protecting preserves.

###  Stewardship and the Future of Land Conservation

*   **Ensuring Long-Term Protection:** Effective stewardship is crucial for ensuring the long-term protection of the conservation values of preserves.
*   **Legacy for Future Generations:** Stewardship ensures that the land will be enjoyed by future generations in the same condition that inspired its protection. 
*   **Connecting People to Nature:**  Stewardship activities provide opportunities for people to connect with nature, deepening their appreciation for the land and fostering a sense of responsibility for its care.

# Chapter 7: How to Save Land

This chapter discusses the legal and financial mechanisms for land conservation, focusing on:

### Methods of Protecting Land

* **Fee simple** acquisition, which involves outright ownership of the land, and **conservation easements**, which involve the transfer of certain rights to a conservation organization or government agency while the landowner retains ownership.

### **Gifts and Sales**

* The simplest way to protect land is to donate it to a land trust.
* Land can also be sold to a land trust, either at fair market value or at a bargain sale price, which allows the landowner to claim a charitable deduction for the difference.

### More Esoteric Ways to Save Land

* **These methods, often used by landowners with significant assets, can provide financial benefits while ensuring land protection.**
* One example involves a land trust securing funding from donors and combining it with a bargain sale from the landowner to purchase and protect a high-value property while providing an inheritance for the landowner's children. 

### The Conservation Easement Document

* **The document outlines the terms of the easement, including:**
    * **Conveyance**: The transfer of the easement from the donor to the land trust.
    * **Conservation Values**: The specific values of the property that the easement aims to protect.
    * **Prohibited Actions**: Activities that are not allowed on the property to ensure the conservation values are maintained.
    * **Permitted Uses**: Activities that the landowner retains the right to engage in. 
    * **Other Articles**: Routine legal provisions.

### Conservation Easements from the Standpoint of the Land Trust

* While land trusts might prefer fee simple ownership for complete control over stewardship, conservation easements offer a more cost-effective way to protect larger areas.
* **The trade-off involves balancing the landowner's desired uses with the land trust's conservation goals.**

### Public Benefit

* **Conservation easements, even without public access, provide public benefits, including:**
    * Scenic beauty
    * Ecosystem services like water purification
    * Habitat for wildlife
    * Opportunities for local food production

* **It is essential that easements are carefully crafted to ensure these benefits are secured.**

### Why Owners Protect Their Land

* **Studies show that landowners are motivated by a combination of factors:**
    * **Personal Commitment to the Land**: A desire to protect its natural beauty and prevent its exploitation. 
    * **Stewardship**:  A desire to ensure the land is managed responsibly for future generations.
    * **Economic Concerns**: Tax benefits and property tax reductions.

# Chapter 8: Defending Conservation Easements

### Monitoring

Land trusts need to **regularly revisit each easement property, at least annually**, for two main reasons: 

* **To identify any violations** that may have occurred since the last visit. 
* **To monitor ongoing changes** in the property. Natural ecosystems are in constant flux, with changes in hydrology, succession, and plant and animal ranges, and a land trust **needs to know the current state of each property to ensure that it's effectively protecting the intended conservation values**.

### Baseline Documentation

Baseline documentation is **essential for successfully defending a conservation easement** in case of a serious challenge. It's **analogous to the plans and specifications used in construction**, providing a detailed record of the property's condition at the time the easement was granted. This documentation is crucial for establishing a clear understanding of what was intended to be protected.

### The Liberty Ship Mentality

Unfortunately, **some land trusts fall short in baseline documentation and monitoring** due to what's referred to as the "Liberty ship mentality." During World War II, Liberty ships were mass-produced rapidly, with a focus on speed over long-term durability.  **This approach led to quality issues that manifested later**. Similarly, some land trusts prioritize quickly acquiring easements without sufficient attention to the long-term requirements of monitoring and enforcement.

### Underestimation of Violations

**The actual frequency of conservation easement violations may be higher than reported**. A study in the San Francisco Bay Area found that 14% of easements had violations, but this figure only accounts for the easements that were being monitored. Since the same study found that only about half of the easements were being monitored, the **actual violation rate could be significantly higher**.

### Addressing Violations

When violations do occur, **the goal is to restore the conservation values in the simplest and least confrontational way possible**. Fortunately, **most landowners are willing to rectify the situation once they understand the problem and the terms of the easement**. Sometimes, the language in an easement can be vague or open to misinterpretation, leading to unintentional violations.

### Amending Easements

While **amending an easement can sometimes be the best way to resolve a problem, it's generally advisable to keep amendments rare**. Amending an easement can be complex, involving considerations such as tax deductions, private benefit, conservation values, the original donor's intent, and public perception.

The generally accepted rule for amendments is to **consider them only if they won't harm and preferably enhance the conservation values**, and if the easement change increases the property's value, the land trust should receive assets of at least equal value.

### The Uncertain Future of Easements

The future of conservation easements remains somewhat uncertain.  There have been both positive and negative legal developments. While some court decisions have supported the validity and enforceability of easements, other trends, such as questions about the charitable trust doctrine, raise concerns about their long-term strength. 

On the positive side, **land trusts are becoming more aware of the importance of carefully drafting and defending easements** to ensure their lasting effectiveness. 

# Chapter 9: The Land Trust Alliance

### Origins of the Land Trust Alliance

* In 1982, the **Land Trust Exchange** was created to support and promote the land trust movement. 
* It later became the **Land Trust Alliance (LTA)**.
* **The LTA** aimed to provide a **practical, experience-based approach** to land conservation, as reflected in their Standards and Practices Guidebook.

### Publications and Programs

* The LTA's magazine, **Exchange,** has been a **key source of information** for land trusts for over two decades.
* **Exchange** consistently addresses **legal issues**, **public policy**, **fundraising**, and **news about the LTA** and the broader land trust movement.
* The magazine also heavily features articles about **conservation easements**.
* This focus on easements is also evident in the LTA's **annual rallies**, where **easement-related presentations** far outnumber those on other land protection methods.
* **Possible reasons** for this emphasis include:
    * The **complexity** of easements, requiring more explanation.
    * A **preference** within the LTA for this method of land protection.

### Shifts in Focus

* Over time, **Exchange** has seen a **decline** in articles on **preserve acquisition and stewardship**, while the focus on **easement monitoring and defense** has increased.
* The magazine has also given **limited coverage** to **non-financial motives** for saving land and to **educational initiatives**. 

### The LTA's Influence and Future Directions

* The LTA has played a **significant role** in **promoting and guiding** the land trust movement.
* The organization's **emphasis** on **conservation easements** has likely **influenced** the **widespread adoption** of this land protection method.
* However, the LTA's **limited focus** on **other aspects** of land conservation, such as **stewardship** and **non-financial motivations**, may need **reconsideration**.
* The LTA is also encouraged to **expand its educational efforts** to better inform the public about land conservation and the benefits of protected land. 

# Chapter 10: The Nature Conservancy

### The Nature Conservancy's Origins and Early History

*   The Nature Conservancy (TNC) is a **large, international conservation organization** that has **protected millions of acres of land** around the world. Its **roots can be traced back to the early 20th century**, when a group of ecologists formed the Ecological Society of America's (ESA) Committee for the Preservation of Natural Conditions to advocate for the protection of natural areas for scientific research.
*   The **committee struggled to be effective as an advocacy group**, and it eventually **split into two committees**. The Study Committee focused on research, while the Preservation Committee continued to advocate for land protection.
*   **Frustrated** by the **slow pace of government action**, the Preservation Committee **decided to take matters into its own hands** and began **acquiring land** for preservation. The committee incorporated as the Ecologists Union (EU) in 1946 and changed its name to The Nature Conservancy in 1950.

### The Nature Conservancy's Transformation and Growth

*   In the early years, **TNC was a small, volunteer-run organization** that focused on **protecting small parcels of land** that were of **high ecological value**. The organization's first major publication was an inventory of nature sanctuaries in the United States and Canada, which was an update of the *Naturalist's Guide to the Americas*.
*   Over time, **TNC grew in size and sophistication**. The organization **developed a professional staff** and began to **focus on protecting larger tracts of land** and landscapes. This shift was driven by the **emerging field of conservation biology**, which emphasized the importance of protecting large, intact ecosystems.
*   **Katharine Ordway**, a philanthropist who was **passionate about prairie conservation**, played a **key role in TNC's growth** during this period. Ordway's generous donations allowed TNC to acquire large tracts of prairie land, which helped to **shift the organization's focus from small parcels to landscapes**.
*   TNC's **approach** to land conservation **continued to evolve** in the 1980s and 1990s. The organization **adopted the Natural Heritage Program**, which uses scientific data to identify and prioritize areas for conservation. TNC also began to **focus on working with local communities** to develop conservation strategies that benefit both people and nature.

### The Nature Conservancy's Current State

*   Today, **TNC is one of the largest and most respected conservation organizations in the world**. The organization has **protected over 12 million acres of land in the United States** and has helped to protect over 60 million acres elsewhere in the world. TNC has a **membership of over one million people** and a **staff of nearly 3,000**.
*   TNC's **mission** is to **"conserve the lands and waters on which all life depends"**. The organization **uses a variety of strategies to achieve this mission**, including **land acquisition, conservation easements, and working with local communities**.
*   TNC is also a **leader in the field of conservation science**. The organization's scientists **conduct research** to **better understand the threats to biodiversity** and to **develop strategies for conservation**. TNC also **works to share this knowledge** with other conservation organizations and with the public.

### The Nature Conservancy's Strengths and Challenges

*   TNC's **strengths** include its **size**, its **financial resources**, its **scientific expertise**, and its **commitment to working with local communities**. The organization's **size and financial resources** allow it to **undertake large-scale conservation projects**. TNC's **scientific expertise** ensures that its conservation efforts are based on the **best available science**. And the organization's **commitment to working with local communities** helps to ensure that its conservation efforts are **sustainable**.
*   However, TNC also **faces a number of challenges**. 
    *   One challenge is the **increasing pace of habitat loss** around the world. TNC must work quickly to **identify and protect** the **most important areas for conservation** before they are lost to development.
    *   Another challenge is the **need to find ways to balance the needs of people** with the **needs of nature**. TNC must develop conservation strategies that **benefit both people and nature** in order to be successful.
    *   Finally, TNC must **ensure that its conservation efforts are sustainable**. The organization must find ways to **engage local communities** in conservation and to **develop long-term funding mechanisms** to support its work.

### The Nature Conservancy's Future

*   The **future of TNC** will be **shaped by the challenges** it faces. 
    *   The organization must continue to **innovate** and to **develop new strategies** to **meet the growing threats to biodiversity**. 
    *   TNC must also continue to **build partnerships** with other conservation organizations, with governments, and with local communities. Only by working together can we hope to **conserve the lands and waters on which all life depends**.

### TNC and Local Land Trusts

*   It is important to note that TNC's **focus on large-scale conservation projects** has led to a **gap in conservation efforts** at the local level. Many local land trusts have stepped in to fill this gap, protecting smaller properties that are important for local biodiversity and ecosystem services. 
*   TNC often collaborates with local land trusts, sharing resources and expertise to achieve shared conservation goals. This collaboration is essential for ensuring that conservation efforts are effective at all scales.

# Chapter 11: The Trust for Public Land

### Origins and Mission

*   The Trust for Public Land (TPL) is a national land trust that **specializes in helping communities acquire land for parks, gardens, greenways, and other public spaces**.
*   TPL was **founded in 1972** by a group of people who believed that everyone should have access to nature.
*   TPL's **mission is to "conserve land for people to enjoy as parks, gardens, and natural areas, ensuring livable communities for generations to come"**.

### Approach and Scale

*   TPL **works with local governments, community groups, and other partners to identify and acquire land for public use**.
*   The organization uses a variety of tools to acquire land, **including purchase, donation, and conservation easements**.
*   TPL is willing to **work on projects of all sizes**, from small urban gardens to large wilderness areas.
*   TPL has saved big parcels too. One example is the **13,500-acre Pond of Safety Forest** linking the northern and southern units of the White Mountain National Forest (New Hampshire). Another, a collaboration with the Save-the-Redwoods League, with funding from the Packard Foundation, is the **Coast Dairies property, up the California coast from Santa Cruz: 7,000 acres with seven miles of ocean shoreline**.

### Financial Resources and Impact

*   TPL's cash flow is **an order of magnitude below TNC's**, but the approximately **\$70 million annual income allows it to save a lot of land**. 
*   In the **twenty-five years from 1973 to 2000, it had done over 1,900 deals protecting about 1.2 million acres**.

### Planning Process and Community Involvement

*   TPL's planning process **emphasizes community involvement and collaboration**.
*   The organization works with local residents to **identify their needs and priorities for public spaces**.
*   TPL also **helps communities develop plans for managing and maintaining their new parks and open spaces**.

### Comparison with The Nature Conservancy

*   TPL is **similar to The Nature Conservancy (TNC) in that it is a national land trust that works to protect land**.
*   However, there are also some **key differences between the two organizations**. 
    *   TPL **focuses on acquiring land for public use**, while TNC primarily focuses on protecting land for its biodiversity value.
    *   TPL is also generally willing to **work on smaller projects than TNC**.

# Chapter 12: Farmland Protection
