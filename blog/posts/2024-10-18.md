# Chapter 1

**Dhirubhai Ambani was born to be a trader.** His family belongs to the Bania caste, a group within the traditional Hindu social order associated with merchants and bankers. This gave him an automatic social network and expectations that made commerce a natural and honorable career choice.   Ambani's family followed **Vaishnavism**, a branch of Hinduism popular in Gujarat that emphasizes devotion to Lord Vishnu. This philosophy gave a sense of purpose to their roles as providers and family members, fitting the rising social status of the Banias in the region.

Ambani's **father was a schoolteacher** who lived a simple and austere life, earning very little.   The family lived in a small, two-roomed stone dwelling.   The **Second World War had little impact** on the region of Kathiawar, where Ambani grew up. 

# Chapter 2

Ambani's experience in **Aden**, Yemen, exposed him to a multicultural environment and provided valuable lessons in trading and navigating diverse social circles.   The **Gujarati community in East Africa** was known for its frugality and hard work.   They were successful migrants who accumulated wealth through rigorous saving and long working hours, often relying on the labor of unpaid family members.   This success, however, led to resentment from locals, resulting in their expulsion and the seizure of their assets after the colonies gained independence.   The **Gujarati diaspora** then spread worldwide, taking their commercial drive and skills with them.

Ambani's **early business practices** in Bombay involved importing yarn and supplying it to textile mills. He was known for his **competitive spirit** and open approach to business dealings. His rivals acknowledged his ambition and determination.

# Chapter 3

Ambani's early days in Bombay were marked by **austere living conditions**. He lived in a **crowded, noisy, and dirty** apartment with his wife and four children. These experiences shaped the **ambition** of his two sons, Mukesh and Anil, who later assumed leadership roles in Reliance Industries.

# Chapter 4

Ambani's textile business, **Reliance Industries**, experienced significant growth and success. He established a large factory in Naroda, employing a considerable workforce. Ambani introduced his own **brand name, Vimal**, and created a network of franchised shops to sell his products. He was recognized for his **dynamic leadership** and credited with the success of the Vimal brand. The appearance of snakes during the factory's construction was seen as a **good omen**, further associating Ambani with fortune and success.

# Chapter 5

Ambani's success was attributed to his **strategic cultivation of relationships**, from low-level employees to high-ranking officials.   He had a **remarkable memory for names and faces**, and he believed in **"salaaming" (bowing down to)** anyone who could be helpful.   This approach was essential in navigating the bureaucratic hurdles of the "**Licence Raj**," where government control over industries required businesses to secure approvals and licenses.

Ambani took advantage of **loopholes and amendments** in economic policies to benefit his business. He cultivated relationships with **influential politicians**, including Indira Gandhi's private secretary, Yashpal Kapur, and his successor, R. K. Dhawan.

# Chapter 6

Ambani positioned himself as an **underdog** fighting against the established business elite. He exploited the perception of an **inner circle** within the Licence Raj, highlighting the dominance of the Birla group, which had received a significant share of government-approved industrial investments. Ambani contrasted his outsider status with the Birla family's long-standing political connections and their use of philanthropy to gain public favor.

Ambani secured financial support from institutions like the **Syndicate Bank** and the **Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI)**. He impressed these backers with his **enthusiasm, clear business proposals, and knowledge of the market**. Ambani's commitment to using **high-quality equipment and personnel** further solidified their confidence in him. His **strategic donations to educational institutions** associated with his financial backers enhanced his reputation and strengthened these relationships.

# Chapter 7

Ambani took advantage of the **Higher Unit Value Scheme**, which allowed businesses to import raw materials at low international prices and sell finished goods domestically at much higher prices. This scheme generated substantial profits for Reliance. He aggressively pursued **export opportunities**, focusing on markets like Poland and Saudi Arabia. To enhance his company's image and export activities, Ambani used **publicity stunts** such as taking out full-page newspaper advertisements to announce charter flights carrying his products to foreign markets. 

Ambani's competitors accused him of exploiting the Higher Unit Value Scheme for personal gain. He defended himself by claiming that the scheme was available to all businesses and that his success was due to his entrepreneurial spirit.

# Chapter 8

Ambani further expanded Reliance by venturing into the **texturizing business**, processing polyester fiber to enhance its qualities. His **bold business maneuvers** and ability to overcome challenges contributed to his growing reputation.   For example, when faced with rumors of financial troubles, Ambani publicly offered to repay any outstanding debts, demonstrating his confidence and silencing his critics. 

He maintained a **close relationship with influential figures** in the government, such as T. A. Pai, who continued to support Reliance's expansion.   Ambani often made remarks suggesting that he had taken **unconventional measures** to achieve his success, hinting at possible ethically questionable actions that remained hidden.

# Chapter 9

Reliance continued its rapid growth by building a **new polyester filament yarn (PFY) plant** in Patalganga, Maharashtra. This ambitious project was completed in a remarkably short time, showcasing Ambani's efficiency and determination. He capitalized on **policy loopholes** and exploited government regulations to secure advantages for Reliance.

# Chapter 10

Ambani's aggressive business practices led to **conflicts** with other players in the industry. He was accused of **manipulating government policies** to benefit Reliance at the expense of smaller competitors. For example, he advocated for **anti-dumping duties** on imported polyester yarn, which hurt smaller texturizing companies while giving Reliance a significant advantage in the market.

# Chapter 11

Ambani cultivated a **loyal investor base** by promoting Reliance shares as a path to significant wealth. He fostered a sense of **community** among shareholders, referring to them as the **"Reliance family."** Ambani's **financial strategies** generated impressive returns for investors, further solidifying his reputation as a business genius.

# Chapter 12

Ambani's **ambitious expansion plans** involved moving further into the **petrochemicals industry**, aiming to produce a range of chemical products.   He continued to receive praise from analysts and commentators, who acknowledged his **ability to foresee and capitalize on emerging market trends**.  However, his success also attracted criticism and allegations of manipulation and unethical practices. 

Ambani's **public image** was marked by a **combination of admiration and controversy**. He was seen as a **symbol of Gujarati entrepreneurial spirit**, breaking through the barriers of established business communities. His willingness to **bend rules and exploit loopholes** was often rationalized as necessary tactics for an outsider to succeed.

# Chapter 13

Behind Ambani's public persona was a **network of associates and companies** engaged in **manipulating share prices, influencing government policies, and controlling media narratives**. Ambani maintained a complex system to ensure **Reliance's continued success** and maintain a steady flow of public investment.

Ambani's **share price manipulation** involved using a network of investment companies and friendly brokers to buy and sell Reliance shares, creating an illusion of high demand and driving up the price.   He exploited **legal loopholes** and operated in a regulatory environment that lacked explicit laws against insider trading.

# Chapter 14

Ambani's **media strategy** involved cultivating relationships with journalists and editors, using **gifts, financial incentives, and advertising** to influence coverage. He established a network of **"moles"** within the press to plant favorable stories and suppress negative ones.  Ambani's approach to media management was a significant departure from the traditional cautiousness of Indian business leaders.

Ambani's **influence extended beyond reporters** to desk editors and even newspaper owners. He used his **financial power** to silence critics and shape public perception of Reliance.   Ambani also used his media contacts to **gather intelligence on competitors** and spread rumors to undermine their businesses.

# Chapter 15

The **Great Polyester War** was a fierce battle between Ambani and his rivals in the polyester industry, primarily **Nusli Wadia of Bombay Dyeing**. This conflict involved **aggressive business tactics, political maneuvering, and media manipulation**.

Ambani's clash with Wadia escalated when **V. P. Singh**, then the Finance Minister, took steps to regulate the polyester industry, impacting Reliance's profitability.  Ambani retaliated by using his influence to **discredit Wadia** and his company.

# Chapter 16

Ambani's relationship with **Ramnath Goenka**, owner of the **Indian Express** newspapers, soured when Goenka became aware of Ambani's attempts to manipulate the press. Goenka, a powerful media figure, was offended by Ambani's belief that everyone had a price. He decided to **expose Ambani's wrongdoings**, leading to a sustained campaign of investigative journalism against Reliance.

Goenka tasked **S. Gurumurthy**, a young accountant, with uncovering Reliance's secrets.  Gurumurthy's investigations, published in the Indian Express, revealed a complex web of financial manipulations, questionable business practices, and potential legal violations.

# Chapter 17

Gurumurthy's articles focused on Reliance's **exploitation of loopholes** in government regulations, particularly relating to **non-convertible debentures** and investments by **non-resident Indians (NRIs)**. He argued that Reliance's actions distorted financial markets and potentially facilitated the outflow of capital from India.

Gurumurthy continued his investigation, raising concerns about Reliance's **import practices**, alleging potential **smuggling** of equipment and materials. He suggested that Reliance exerted undue influence over government decision-making processes.

# Chapter 18

Gurumurthy's exposé, titled **"Reliance Loan Maha mela,"** revealed Reliance's alleged use of **loans from banks** to manipulate share prices and gain control of other companies. His investigation uncovered a network of **front companies** and questionable financial transactions. 

# Chapter 19

Gurumurthy's efforts to trace the **ownership of Reliance shares** held through offshore companies led him to **Panama and Dubai**, uncovering a complex network of shell companies and nominee shareholders. His investigations suggested that Reliance might be using these offshore structures to obscure the true ownership of shares and potentially evade taxes.

Gurumurthy's findings reignited the controversy surrounding Reliance's acquisition of shares by companies based in the **Isle of Man**, raising suspicions about the legitimacy of these investments and their compliance with Indian regulations.

# Chapter 20

Gurumurthy's investigation into Reliance's finances revealed **potential discrepancies in reported profits** and highlighted the company's reliance on **political influence** to secure favorable outcomes.  His articles challenged the narrative of Reliance's success as solely a result of business acumen, suggesting that manipulation and questionable practices played a significant role.

The **Indian Express** faced legal challenges from Reliance in an attempt to suppress Gurumurthy's reporting.  Reliance sought to silence the newspaper through **court injunctions**, claiming that the articles contained false information and damaged the company's reputation. 

# Chapter 21

Despite Reliance's attempts to silence the Indian Express, the newspaper continued its investigation, publishing further allegations of **financial irregularities** and **manipulation of share prices**. The newspaper's relentless reporting contributed to a decline in Reliance's share price. 

Reliance faced multiple legal challenges, including a lawsuit alleging that the company had **defrauded debenture holders** by issuing a new series of convertible debentures without properly considering their rights. 

# Chapter 22

Amidst the ongoing controversy and legal battles, Reliance successfully launched a **new series of convertible debentures (G Series)**, raising significant capital.  The company's ability to attract investment despite negative publicity showcased Ambani's **influence and persuasive power**.

Reliance utilized aggressive tactics to **counter negative market sentiment**, including pressuring brokers to cover their short positions, which led to losses for those betting against the company's share price.

# Chapter 23

The **Fairfax affair** involved the hiring of a US-based private investigative firm, Fairfax Group, to investigate Reliance's overseas financial dealings.  The circumstances surrounding Fairfax's engagement and the subsequent controversy highlighted the **political intrigue** surrounding Reliance and its alleged connections to powerful figures. 

The investigation into Fairfax led to the **transfer of V. P. Singh** from the Finance Ministry and the **removal of Bhure Lal**, the Enforcement Director who had hired Fairfax, from his position. 

# Chapter 24

The Fairfax affair took a dramatic turn with the emergence of **forged letters** implicating Reliance's rivals, including Nusli Wadia, in a conspiracy to undermine the government. The letters alleged that Wadia had secretly funded Fairfax and sought to use the investigation for his own benefit. 

The forged letters led to a **criminal investigation**, targeting those perceived as enemies of the government.  The **CBI** was used to harass and intimidate individuals who had challenged Reliance.

# Chapter 25

The **publication of the forged Fairfax letters** in the Indian Express exposed the attempts to frame Reliance's opponents. The letters were revealed to be **fabrications**, discrediting the government's narrative and highlighting the extent to which it was willing to go to protect its allies.
