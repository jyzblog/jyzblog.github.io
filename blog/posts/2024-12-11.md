# Chapter 1: Introduction

### The Next Generation

Startup communities are no longer uncommon. In 2020, they are flourishing all over the world. The current phase of startup community development is concerned with how startup communities can successfully coexist with more traditional hierarchical institutions. Clarity and a respect for one another's strengths are essential for these entities to maximize their impact. The *Startup Community Way* aims to better align relevant parties such as founders, governments, service providers, community builders, and corporations. The book builds off of the success of *Startup Communities*, benchmarking progress, developing new areas of inquiry, and taking the content in a new direction. Over the past eight years, the advice surrounding startup communities, particularly as they evolve, has become overly complicated and inaccessible.

### Our Approach 

This book uses a pragmatic, research-based approach to address this hurdle, creating a new framework for startup communities while differentiating them from, and integrating them with, entrepreneurial ecosystems. The authors have different perspectives and have been able to challenge each other to consider the topic from multiple viewpoints. Their collective experience and knowledge is a starting point, and the book builds on the work of many people. The book draws from a wide range of resources including academic papers, business and policy research, books, case studies, and informal commentary. The authors have spoken to thousands of entrepreneurs and startup community participants.  

### A Deeper Motivation

The book addresses the gap between entrepreneurs and everyone else in the startup community created by labeling entrepreneurs as leaders and everyone else as feeders. This gap resulted in many people thinking leaders were more important than feeders, which was not the intention. Both leaders and feeders are critical to the health and growth of a startup community.  *Startup Communities* introduced the **Boulder Thesis**, which laid out four principles for building a startup community:

1. Entrepreneurs must lead the startup community. 
2. The leaders must have a long-term commitment. 
3. The startup community must be inclusive of anyone who wants to participate in it. 
4. The startup community must have continual activities that engage the entire entrepreneurial stack.

### The Boulder Thesis

Although the Boulder Thesis was simple yet powerful, many people who followed it were unsure of what to do next. This book **addresses this issue**, and introduces a new framework called the **Startup Community Way**. The Startup Community Way builds on the Boulder Thesis, using the framework of complex adaptive systems to support it.  Many of the mistakes people make surrounding startup communities are similar to mistakes people make when interacting with complex adaptive systems. This book explores those mistakes, but it is not a manual on how to build a startup community. The book provides guiding principles and insights for discovery, with practical insights for startup community building, managing a business, designing effective public policies, and being a better leader or mentor. 

### Startup Communities are Complex Adaptive Systems 

**Complex adaptive systems** are a type of system with nonlinear and dynamic properties. Startup communities are complex adaptive systems. 

### Where We Were in 2012 

In 2012, when *Startup Communities* was written, there was little substantive content on the topic. The term "startup communities" was new and has become the definitive term for the phenomenon. 

### Where We are Now in 2020

Since 2012, exploration and progress has occurred surrounding startup communities, but the advice and tactics surrounding them, particularly as they evolve, have become convoluted and inaccessible.

### Using Complexity Theory to Explain Startup Communities

**Complexity theory** helps to explain startup communities. The authors looked at the mistakes people make when interacting with complex adaptive systems and found similarities to the mistakes people make when dealing with startup communities. These include:

*   Applying linear systems thinking in a nonlinear world.
*   Attempting to control a startup community.
*   Addressing problems in isolation.
*   Focusing on the parts of a startup community rather than the interactions between them.
*   Believing that a startup community is formulaic or replicable.
*   Measuring the wrong things, especially things that are easy to capture but are less important for driving performance.

### Evolving the Boulder Thesis to the Startup Community Way

The book builds on the value of the Boulder Thesis, using the framework of complex adaptive systems to support it, and introduces a new framework: the **Startup Community Way**.  The Startup Community Way is not a replacement of the Boulder Thesis, but an evolution, and a superset. **The Startup Community Way** consists of twelve principles:

1.  Entrepreneurs must lead the startup community. 
2.  The leaders must have a long-term commitment. 
3.  Startup communities are complex adaptive systems that emerge from the interaction of the participants. 
4.  Startup communities can be guided and influenced, but not controlled. 
5.  Each startup community is unique and cannot be replicated. 
6.  Startup communities are organized through networks of trust, not hierarchies.
7.  The startup community must be inclusive of anyone who wants to participate. 
8.  Openness, support, and collaboration are critical behaviors in a startup community. 
9.  The startup community must have continual activities that meaningfully engage the entire entrepreneurial stack. 
10. Startup communities must avoid the trap of letting demand for measurement drive flawed strategies. 
11. Putting founders first, giving before you get, and having an intense love of place are essential values in a startup community. 
12. Startup communities are propelled by entrepreneurial success and the recycling of those resources back into the next generation. 

It's important to note that every startup community should focus on being its best version, not replicating another startup community like Silicon Valley. Each city has its own origin story and history, and a unique set of resources. 

# Chapter 2: Why Startup Communities Exist

This chapter of *The Startup Community Way: Evolving an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem* explains why startup communities exist. It covers what entrepreneurs do, the impact of the external environment, and how the structure of startup communities as networks of trust fosters entrepreneurship.  The chapter also explores the impact of entrepreneurial density on startup communities, and how quality of place has become a key factor in the modern economy.

### What Entrepreneurs Do

* Entrepreneurship has a broad definition that encompasses a wide range of activities.
* It's important to differentiate between **startup entrepreneurs** and **small business owners**. Startup entrepreneurs are distinguished by their ambition to create something new and grow their businesses substantially. Small businesses expect to stay small. 
* The authors provide an example to illustrate this point: **Most small businesses expect to stay small. Startup founders set out to do something fundamentally different, proliferate, and create significant economic value.** 
* This distinction is important because the approach to assisting and supporting these two types of businesses will be different. 
* The authors highlight the work they did in their previous book, *Startup Opportunities: Know When to Quit Your Day Job*, which examined this distinction.

### The External Environment

* **The external environment plays a crucial role in shaping a startup community's success.** This includes factors such as access to resources, regulations, and the overall business climate.
* **The structure of organizations within startup communities is also significant.** Networks, characterized by flexibility and adaptability, are better suited for innovation and entrepreneurship than traditional hierarchies, which rely on formal rules and chains of command.
* The authors state that **"Healthy startup communities rely upon unencumbered information flows organized in network-based structures. Conversely, they suffocate under hierarchical control."**
* The example of **Silicon Valley vs. Route 128** is provided to illustrate this point. In her book *Regional Advantage: Culture and Competition in Silicon Valley and Route 128*, AnnaLee Saxenian, an economic geographer, compared the two tech hubs.  Silicon Valley embraced a decentralized, fluid, and bottom-up culture. Route 128 was characterized by a controlled, top-down approach. As a result, in the 1990s, Silicon Valley thrived while Route 128 stagnated.

### Networks over Hierarchies

* **Startup communities flourish when organized as networks of trust, as this structure promotes collaboration and information sharing.** 
* To overcome the human tendency to distrust those who are different, startup communities need to embrace diversity. This is discussed further in Chapter 15: Diversity is a Feature, Not a Bug.
* The book, *The Rainforest: The Secret to Building the Next Silicon Valley* by Victor Hwang and Greg Horowitt, emphasizes the importance of diverse teams and the need to overcome the natural human tendency towards distrusting those who are different.

### Networks of Trust 

* **Trust is crucial for startup community success.** It fosters collaboration, knowledge sharing, and a willingness to help others. 
* Honesty and transparency are fundamental values that support trust within a startup community. This is emphasized in the "Values and Virtues: Be Transparent and Honest" section. 
* The chapter emphasizes the importance of giving and receiving feedback constructively, especially in challenging situations. 

### Density and Agglomeration

* **Entrepreneurial density, the concentration of entrepreneurs and resources in a specific location, is a key driver of startup community success.** This fosters a sense of community, increases opportunities for collaboration and serendipitous encounters, and accelerates knowledge sharing.
* **The concept of "startup neighborhoods" is introduced.** These are clusters of startups within a larger city, and they highlight the importance of density for entrepreneurial activity. 
* The authors use the **examples of Boston and New York City** to illustrate the existence and importance of startup neighborhoods. 

### Quality of Place

* **Quality of place has become increasingly important for attracting talent and fostering startup communities.** Factors such as affordability, livability, cultural amenities, and a vibrant social scene influence entrepreneurs' decisions on where to locate their businesses.
* The chapter cautions against the dangers of creating a **zero-sum mentality** between different startup neighborhoods. It's more productive to view them as interconnected parts of a larger community. 

# Chapter 3: The Actors

This chapter of *The Startup Community Way* focuses on the people and organizations, or **actors**, involved in a startup community. The chapter also introduces a key principle of startup communities: **"The primary purpose of a startup community is to help entrepreneurs succeed"**. Without entrepreneurs, there is no startup community, and entrepreneurial success is vital for inspiring and sustaining future generations of entrepreneurs. 

### Leaders, Feeders, and Instigators

The actors in a startup community are divided into three types: **leaders, feeders, and instigators**. **Leaders** are the entrepreneurs, and they are the most critical actors.  **Feeders** are everyone else who participates in the startup community.  **Instigators** are non-entrepreneurs who play key leadership roles in the community.

It's important to note that, while the authors categorized actors this way in the past, they have simplified the categories since writing *Startup Communities*. Now they use the categories **actors** and **factors**. **Actors include leaders, feeders, and instigators**. **Factors include the Seven Capitals**.

The authors acknowledge that they initially created an unintentional divide between entrepreneurs (leaders) and everyone else (feeders) when writing *Startup Communities*. They stress that **both leaders and feeders are essential to the health of a startup community**. 

### Actors

The chapter then describes the different people and organizations within each category of actor. 

#### Leaders

* **Entrepreneurs:** The heart of a startup community. Startup entrepreneurs are differentiated from traditional small business owners because of their **ambition to create something new and substantially grow their business**.

#### Feeders

* **Mentors:** Experienced entrepreneurs or individuals with knowledge and expertise who volunteer their time to help startups. Mentors should embrace the **#GiveFirst** approach. The authors define #GiveFirst as putting energy into a relationship or system without defining the transactional parameters.  **#GiveFirst is the mantra of Techstars and the authors' fundamental philosophy of business**.
* **Investors:** A diverse category that includes angel investors, venture capitalists, and others who provide capital to startups. 
* **Service Providers:** Lawyers, accountants, and other professionals who provide essential services to startups.
* **Government:** Local, regional, or national governments can play a role in supporting startup communities through policies, programs, and funding.
* **Universities:** Colleges and universities are a source of talent, research, and entrepreneurial education.
* **Large Corporations:** Can provide partnerships, mentorship, and customer relationships to startups.

#### Instigators

* **Community Builders:**  Focus on building relationships and fostering a sense of community among entrepreneurs and other stakeholders. 
* **Accelerators and Incubators:**  Provide resources, mentorship, and networking opportunities to startups in a structured program.

The chapter concludes with an anecdote from Scott Dorsey, an entrepreneur who has played a significant role in building the startup community in Indianapolis. Dorsey highlights the importance of **#GiveFirst**, **conviction**, and **creating value without expectation of immediate return**.

# Chapter 4: The Factors

This chapter discusses the **factors** or conditions in a city that either support or hinder entrepreneurs trying to succeed. It uses a framework called the **Seven Capitals** to organize these factors.

### The Seven Capitals Framework

The Seven Capitals framework is useful for understanding the resources in a startup community for a few reasons. First, it provides a comprehensive overview of all of the important resources. Second, it describes how these resources are valuable and degradable over time, but also how they can grow in the future. Finally, it changes how people in the startup community think about capital, making them realize it's not just about money. 

Here is a list of the **Seven Capitals**: 

1.  **Intellectual capital**: ideas, information, technologies, stories, educational activities
2.  **Human capital**: talent, knowledge, skills, experience, diversity
3.  **Financial capital**: revenue, debt, equity, or grant financing
4.  **Network capital**: connectedness, relationships, bondedness
5.  **Cultural capital**: attitudes, mindset, behaviors, history, inclusiveness
6.  **Physical capital**: infrastructure, real estate, transportation, housing
7.  **Institutional capital**: government, laws, policies, regulations

### Factors and Their Impact on Entrepreneurs

The resources and conditions described in the Seven Capitals are also called **factors**, which entrepreneurs operate within. An example of how one factor can support a startup community comes from the story of **Startland News** in Kansas City. This media outlet focuses on sharing positive stories about the people in the startup community, showing their struggles and successes to inspire others and normalize entrepreneurial behavior. 

However, just understanding the individual factors isn't enough. What matters most is how they interact with each other and the **entrepreneurs** at the center of it all. One common mistake is thinking you just need "more of everything" to improve a startup community. A better approach is focusing on how to improve what you already have. By making small changes in how people behave, you can make a big difference in the long run. 

# Chapter 5: Startup Communities versus Entrepreneurial Ecosystems

This chapter clarifies the relationship between startup communities and entrepreneurial ecosystems, arguing that **startup communities are a subset of entrepreneurial ecosystems**. It emphasizes that the two concepts, while related, have **different purposes**.

### Entrepreneurial Ecosystems

* Entrepreneurial ecosystems encompass the broader environment in which entrepreneurship occurs, including all of the actors and factors discussed in the previous chapters.
* **The primary purpose of an entrepreneurial ecosystem is to generate economic growth for a region**. This involves creating jobs, attracting investment, and fostering innovation.
* Entrepreneurial ecosystems are often seen as complex, interconnected systems, with a focus on the various elements that contribute to economic growth. 
* Some models of entrepreneurial ecosystems are overly complicated and fail to provide clear entry points for implementing meaningful change.

### Alignment of Actors

* While entrepreneurial ecosystems encompass a wide range of stakeholders, **startup communities prioritize the needs of entrepreneurs**.
*  Startup communities focus on **fostering a culture of collaboration and support among entrepreneurs and other key actors**, like mentors, investors, and support organizations.
* This alignment is essential for creating a **positive and productive environment** for entrepreneurs to thrive.

### Different, but Mutually Reinforcing, Purpose

* **The primary purpose of a startup community is to help entrepreneurs succeed**. This success, in turn, contributes to the overall economic growth of the entrepreneurial ecosystem.
* Startup communities **prioritize the human element of entrepreneurship**, focusing on **building relationships and fostering a collaborative culture**.
* Entrepreneurial ecosystems, while also concerned with people, often **prioritize the measurement of economic outcomes**, such as job creation and investment attraction. 
* The two concepts are **mutually reinforcing**: a strong startup community contributes to a vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem, and a supportive ecosystem can help entrepreneurs in a startup community to succeed.

### Systems within Systems

* **Startup communities can be seen as systems operating within the larger system of the entrepreneurial ecosystem**.
* **Each system has its own set of actors, factors, and feedback loops**.
* It's important to understand how these **systems interact and influence each other**.
*  For example, a change in government policy (an element of the entrepreneurial ecosystem) could have a significant impact on the availability of funding for startups (a factor within the startup community).

### Entrepreneurial Success

* **The success of entrepreneurs is crucial for both startup communities and entrepreneurial ecosystems**.
* Entrepreneurial success **generates wealth, creates jobs, and inspires others to pursue entrepreneurship**.
* Successful entrepreneurs often become mentors, investors, and leaders within the startup community, **recycling their resources and knowledge back into the system**.
*  This **entrepreneurial recycling** is essential for the long-term health and sustainability of both the startup community and the entrepreneurial ecosystem.

### Community/Ecosystem Fit

* Entrepreneurs should consider **both the startup community and the broader entrepreneurial ecosystem when deciding where to locate their business**.
* **Community/ecosystem fit** refers to the alignment between an entrepreneur's needs and the resources and support available in a particular location. 
* Factors to consider include the **availability of talent, mentorship, funding, and a supportive culture**.
* Choosing a location with a **strong startup community and a supportive entrepreneurial ecosystem** can significantly increase an entrepreneur's chances of success. 

# Chapter 6: Putting the System Back into Ecosystem

This chapter introduces the concept of systems and explains why viewing startup communities as complex systems is crucial for understanding their dynamics and fostering their growth. The chapter emphasizes the need to move away from linear thinking and embrace a holistic perspective that considers the interconnectedness of various actors and factors within a startup community. 

### Introduction to Systems

* This section defines a **system** as a group of entities that interact with each other to collectively produce something.
* The three core elements of a system are **parts, interdependencies, and purpose**.
* Additional relevant system properties include **boundaries, properties of scale, and dimensions of time**.
* **Boundaries** define the limits of a system, separating it from the external environment.
* **Properties of scale** refer to how the behavior of a system changes at different levels of analysis.
* **Dimensions of time** consider how the past, present, and future influence the behavior of a system.

### The Whole System

* Viewing startup communities as whole systems requires understanding the **interconnections** between actors, factors, and the external environment.
* It is crucial to recognize that **actions within a startup community** can have unintended consequences due to these interconnections.
* A **reductionist or siloed approach** fails to capture the complexity of startup communities and can lead to ineffective strategies.
* Startup communities exhibit **nonlinear behavior**, meaning that changes in one part of the system can have disproportionate effects on other parts.
* The **interactions** between actors and factors are more important than the individual elements themselves.
* **Understanding the history and local context** of a startup community is essential for appreciating its unique dynamics.

### Simple, Complicated, and Complex Activities

* This section distinguishes between three types of activities: **simple, complicated, and complex**.
* **Simple activities** have a clear definition of success, well-understood procedures, and predictable outcomes.
* **Complicated activities** involve more steps and require greater precision in execution, but they are still predictable and controllable.
* **Complex activities** have a high degree of uncertainty, unpredictable outcomes, and require a different approach compared to simple and complicated activities.

### Moving from Activities to Systems

* **Simple systems** have few elements, straightforward procedures, and predictable outcomes. Examples: baking a cake, unlocking a car door, brewing coffee.
* **Complicated systems** involve more elements, require expertise, and demand tighter control, but still produce predictable outcomes. Examples: landing a spacecraft on the moon, designing a car, preparing financial statements.
* **Complex systems** are characterized by interconnectedness, emergence, self-organization, and nonlinearity. Examples: ecosystems, economies, startup communities.

This chapter lays the groundwork for the rest of Part II of the book, which explores startup communities as complex systems. It highlights the need to shift from linear, reductionist thinking to a holistic, systems-based perspective to effectively engage with the dynamics of startup communities. 

# Chapter 7: Unpredictable Creativity

This chapter of *The Startup Community Way: Evolving an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem*  explores unpredictable creativity as a characteristic of complex systems and startup communities. 

### Emergence 

The concept of **emergence** is introduced in this chapter. Emergence is defined as "the process of coming into being or becoming prominent".  This idea is explored in the context of **complex systems**, in which individual parts interact in an unpredictable way, resulting in outcomes that are more than the sum of their parts. 

The authors offer several examples of emergence:

*   **Ant colonies:** Individual ants have simple behaviors, yet their collective interactions give rise to intricate colonies that function as a unit. 
*   **Human brains:**  Individual neurons are simple cells, but their interactions form complex neural networks capable of thought, learning, and consciousness.
*   **Cities:**  Individual people with their unique needs and wants, interacting with each other and their environment, contribute to the growth and evolution of cities.

The authors argue that emergence is a defining characteristic of **startup communities** as well. The unpredictable interaction between entrepreneurs, investors, and other actors can result in unexpected outcomes and innovations that would not have been possible through planned or top-down approaches. 

The chapter emphasizes the importance of embracing unpredictability and allowing for emergent outcomes in startup communities. 

### Synergies and Nonlinearity

**Synergy** is explained as the creation of a whole that is greater than the simple sum of its parts. Synergies are closely linked to **nonlinearity**, a key characteristic of complex systems, where cause and effect are not proportional. Small changes can have significant effects, and vice versa.

For example:

*   In a startup community, a small investment in a promising company can lead to a disproportionately large return. 
*   A chance encounter between two entrepreneurs at a networking event can spark a collaboration that leads to a breakthrough innovation.

The authors stress the importance of  **diversity in startup communities** as a driver of synergies.  Diversity in skills, backgrounds, and perspectives increases the likelihood of unexpected and valuable interactions.  

The chapter cautions against attempts to control startup communities. Because startup communities are nonlinear systems, predicting outcomes and designing interventions with certainty is challenging. 

### Self-Organization

The concept of **self-organization**, in which order and complexity arise spontaneously without central control or planning, is highlighted. This is a characteristic of complex systems, including startup communities.

The chapter offers the example of **Twitter hashtags**: Hashtags were not part of the original design of Twitter. They emerged organically as users began using the # symbol to categorize and connect their tweets, ultimately influencing how information is shared and consumed on the platform. 

### Dynamism

**Startup communities are dynamic systems** that are constantly changing. The actors, resources, and relationships evolve, influenced by internal and external factors. The authors emphasize the importance of understanding this dynamism when engaging with startup communities.  They caution against static models or interventions that fail to adapt to change.

The authors encourage **flexibility, adaptability, and continuous learning**, for engaging with startup communities. 

### The Study of Interactions

This section focuses on the importance of studying **interactions** within startup communities. 

*   **Complex systems**, including startup communities, are driven by **networks** of relationships, rather than isolated individuals. 
*   To understand these systems, we must go beyond simply measuring inputs and outputs and examine **how the parts connect and influence each other**.

The authors advocate for a shift in focus from measuring isolated parts of the system to understanding **the dynamics of the whole system**.  

The chapter encourages techniques like **network mapping and analysis**  to gain insights into the relationships that drive startup communities. It also stresses the importance of qualitative data gathered through **interviews and observations** to understand the nuances of these interactions. 

This chapter underscores the importance of recognizing startup communities as complex systems. It highlights the need to embrace unpredictability, nurture diversity, and foster self-organization to create environments where innovation can thrive. The chapter concludes by advocating for a shift in focus from isolated parts to the dynamic interplay of relationships within these systems.

# Chapter 8: The Myth of Quantity

This chapter of *The Startup Community Way: Evolving an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem* emphasizes that focusing on quantity over quality in a startup community is a flawed strategy. The interaction between the different components of a startup community is what matters most.

### Startup Communities Are Non-Linear 

Startup communities are **non-linear** and **complex**. Applying **linear systems thinking**, which focuses on quantity, is a flawed strategy. For example, simply increasing the number of startups or investors won't necessarily lead to more successful outcomes. Non-linear, network-based systems demonstrate power-law dynamics, meaning a small number of actors and events drive value in the system.

### Outliers, Not Averages

It's a mistake to assume that value creation in a startup community follows a normal statistical distribution, where understanding average outcomes offers insight into an ecosystem's performance. Since startup communities are non-linear, **rare, high-impact events are more prevalent** than a normal distribution would predict. This results in **fat-tailed distributions**, where a few outliers drive total system value.  Because most startups fail, a **small number of significant wins**, not many small successes, drive economic value. 

### Entrepreneurial Recycling

**Entrepreneurial recycling**, where people involved in a successful startup reinvest their resources into the next generation of entrepreneurs, is essential for a community's success. Visible success stories make the concept of success tangible and inspire others, even though entrepreneurial recycling is hard to measure quantitatively. Success is **crucial to the psychology of a startup community**, especially in places with a history of entrepreneurial failure or structural barriers.

### Leaders as Supernodes

The quality of a network is more important than its size. **Leaders**, particularly successful entrepreneurs, are **supernodes** in the network. Their experience, knowledge, and connections make them highly influential and impactful on the community. A network where the **most influential nodes are successful entrepreneurs** is more likely to have better outcomes than one where influential figures lack this experience. 

This emphasizes that focusing solely on quantitative metrics like the number of startups, investors, or events can be misleading. Instead, it is crucial to consider the quality and interconnectedness of the community, with successful entrepreneurs playing a central role. 

# Chapter 9: The Illusion of Control

This chapter focuses on the mistake of trying to control a startup community.

### Not Controllable 

* Startup communities are complex systems that resist centralized control.
* Attempts to control them through top-down management, often seen in government or corporate-led initiatives, are usually ineffective and can be detrimental.
* **The success of startup communities comes from a bottom-up, emergent process where entrepreneurs drive activity, and interactions between actors create unpredictable outcomes.**

### Not Fully Knowable 

* **Leaders need to acknowledge that they cannot fully understand or predict the behavior of a complex system like a startup community.**
*  Knowledge is always incomplete, and the system is constantly evolving, making it difficult to formulate accurate predictions or create comprehensive blueprints.
* **Embracing uncertainty and adapting to change is crucial for navigating the complexities of a startup community.**

### Feedbacks and Contagion 

* Feedback loops are inherent in complex systems, where actions create reactions that influence subsequent behavior.
* **Contagion, the spread of ideas and behaviors, plays a significant role in shaping the culture of a startup community.**
* **Positive behaviors like mentorship, collaboration, and a willingness to help can spread, amplifying positive outcomes. Negative behaviors can also spread, potentially undermining the community's health.**
* **Entrepreneurs, as leaders, are crucial for setting the tone and promoting positive contagion.**

### Getting Unstuck 

* When startup communities face challenges, a common reaction is to seek a singular solution, often a large-scale intervention.
* **This approach is misguided, as complex systems require addressing multiple interconnected factors, rather than isolating a single element.**
* **Breaking down problems into smaller, more manageable components and experimenting with different solutions is essential for overcoming obstacles and creating lasting change.**

### Letting Go 

* **Leaders must resist the urge to over-engineer or over-control a startup community.**
* **Accepting a degree of uncertainty and giving individuals the freedom to experiment, fail, and adapt is crucial for fostering innovation and resilience.**
* **Embrace the principle of "Don't Over-Engineer Your Engagement" to avoid stifling creativity and allow for organic growth.**

### Example from Source: Troy D'Ambrosio and the University of Utah 

* Troy D'Ambrosio, from the University of Utah, illustrates the importance of letting go of control.
* When tasked with building an entrepreneurship center, **the university, rather than imposing a top-down structure, involved student entrepreneurs in the process, yielding a more successful and sustainable outcome.**
* This example highlights **the power of bottom-up approaches in fostering a thriving startup community.**

This chapter emphasizes that **a startup community's strength lies in its emergent nature**. Leaders should focus on **creating an environment that encourages positive interactions, embraces uncertainty, and allows for adaptation**, rather than trying to control the system's every aspect. 

# Chapter 10: The Absence of a Blueprint

This chapter discusses the common mistake of searching for a blueprint for startup community success, particularly the desire to replicate the success of Silicon Valley.

### Initial Conditions and Basins of Attraction

Startup communities are complex systems, meaning they are sensitive to initial conditions and can evolve in unpredictable ways over time. **Initial conditions** refer to the unique historical, cultural, and economic factors present in a city at a particular point in time. Small differences in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes as a startup community develops.

For example, Silicon Valley benefited from specific historical events, like the presence of Stanford University and its entrepreneurial culture, the rise of the semiconductor industry, and a culture of risk-taking and innovation that was fostered by early pioneers. These factors cannot be easily replicated in other locations.

The concept of **basins of attraction** refers to the idea that complex systems tend to settle into semi-stable states, making it difficult to change their trajectory. Once certain patterns and behaviors become ingrained in a startup community, it can be challenging to shift towards a more positive direction, even with well-intentioned interventions.

For instance, a city with a history of relying on large corporations or government support for economic growth might struggle to foster a culture of bottom-up entrepreneurship. The existing power structures and mindsets can create a lock-in effect that resists change.

### The Narrative Fallacy

The desire for a blueprint often stems from the **narrative fallacy**, a term coined by psychologist Daniel Kahneman. It describes how humans tend to simplify complex events into easily understandable narratives, often overlooking the role of chance and unpredictable factors.

When it comes to startup communities, the narrative fallacy leads to an oversimplification of the factors that contribute to success. For example, some might attribute Silicon Valley's success solely to the availability of venture capital, ignoring the complex interplay of cultural factors, networks, and historical circumstances that played a role.

Attempting to replicate Silicon Valley based on a simplified narrative is likely to fail because it ignores the unique context and initial conditions that shaped its evolution. Each startup community needs to find its own path to success based on its strengths and weaknesses.

### Building on Strengths and Learning from Failures

Instead of seeking a blueprint, startup communities should focus on **building on their existing strengths** and **learning from their failures**. This requires a deep understanding of the local context, including its history, culture, and resources.

Each city has a unique set of assets that can be leveraged for entrepreneurial success. This might include a strong research university, a vibrant arts scene, a history of manufacturing expertise, or a close-knit community. By identifying and building upon these strengths, startup communities can differentiate themselves and attract entrepreneurs who align with their specific offerings.

Furthermore, failure is an inherent part of the entrepreneurial process. Embracing failure as a learning opportunity allows startup communities to adapt and evolve more effectively. Encouraging experimentation and risk-taking, while providing support systems for entrepreneurs who experience setbacks, can contribute to long-term resilience.

### Cultivating Topophilia

The term **topophilia** refers to a strong love of place. Cultivating topophilia among startup community participants is essential for long-term success. When people are deeply connected to their city and believe in its potential, they are more likely to persevere through challenges and contribute to its growth.

A strong sense of place can help attract and retain talent, inspire entrepreneurs to build companies that address local needs, and foster a collaborative spirit among community members. Highlighting the unique qualities of a city, its history, and its cultural offerings can strengthen topophilia and create a sense of shared purpose.

# Chapter 11: The Measurement Trap

This chapter explores the challenges of measuring the success of startup communities, especially when people prioritize easily measured data over more meaningful but harder-to-capture factors.

### The Fundamental Measurement Problem

The authors introduce a key principle: **"When attempting to benchmark one startup community to another, understand that the least important factors are the easiest to measure."**  They argue that many startup communities fall into the **measurement trap**, which is the mistake of focusing on superficial data that can be easily quantified but doesn't tell the whole story. This is because what is easily measured is often prioritized, leading to strategies that don't address the more important, less tangible aspects of a thriving startup community. An example of this is when comparisons between cities rely on standardized metrics that are readily available, such as the number of startups or venture capital invested, without considering the unique qualities and interactions within each startup community.

The authors then describe various approaches to measuring entrepreneurial ecosystems, highlighting their advantages and limitations.

### Actor and Factor Models: A Categorical Approach

Categorical models focus on identifying the key **actors** and **factors** in an ecosystem. They provide a clear and simple way to understand the key components of a startup community. However, this approach often lacks depth because it typically doesn't provide detailed information on the quality, quantity, or relationships between these elements.

### Standardized Metrics Models: A Comparative Approach

These models use standardized metrics to compare different ecosystems.  They rely on readily available data, making them easy to understand and use for benchmarking. However, they can create a false sense of predictability and contribute to the **narrative fallacy**—the tendency to oversimplify complex phenomena. The authors caution against relying too heavily on these comparative models and suggest using them as just one piece of a larger puzzle.

### Network Models: A Relational Approach

Network models focus on the relationships and connections within a startup community. This approach provides valuable insights into the structure and flow of information within the ecosystem. A specific type of network model is **social network analysis**, which explores how individual actors are connected and who has the most influence within the community . 

### Dynamic Models: An Evolutionary Approach

These models consider how ecosystems change and develop over time.  They highlight the importance of understanding the evolutionary path of a startup community and how past events can shape its present state.

### Cultural-Social Models: A Behavioral Approach

Cultural-social models consider the underlying behaviors, attitudes, and norms within a community.  The authors emphasize the significance of these factors, which are often overlooked or dismissed as "soft" data. 

### Logic Models: A Causal Approach

Logic models attempt to understand the cause-and-effect relationships within an ecosystem. They are particularly valuable when evaluating programs and policies designed to support entrepreneurship. An example of a logic model is provided in Figure 11.2, outlining the logic behind a program to improve connectivity and behavior change.

### Agent-Based Models: A Simulation Approach

Agent-based models utilize computer simulations to explore how individual actors within a system interact and influence each other's behavior, which can lead to broader changes across the entire system. This approach allows researchers to test different scenarios and understand how small changes can lead to significant shifts in the overall ecosystem. The authors provide an example of how these models are used to study phenomena like traffic congestion or financial crises.  While there are limitations due to the complexity and data requirements for agent-based models, researchers have begun applying them to study entrepreneurial ecosystems.

### Applying the Different Models

The authors encourage a wide-ranging and pragmatic approach that combines insights from multiple models.  They provide a table summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

### Avoiding the Measurement Trap

To conclude, the chapter offers several practical tips for avoiding the measurement trap:

*   **Be wide-ranging and pragmatic:** Recognize that there's no single perfect approach and embrace insights from multiple models.
*   **Resist the temptation to be overly comparative:**  While benchmarking can be informative, avoid getting caught up in rankings and comparisons that prioritize easily measured factors.
*   **Focus on the connections, not the parts:** Prioritize understanding the relationships and interactions within the ecosystem rather than simply counting the number of startups or investors.
*   **Track everything, especially the changes, over time:** Emphasize longitudinal data that reveals how the ecosystem is evolving and how individual actors are changing their behavior.

Finally, the chapter ends with insights from Rhett Morris, an expert in measuring ecosystems. Morris shares key themes that have emerged from his work:

*   **Clarity and alignment:** Ensure that everyone in the community understands the goals and objectives of measurement efforts.
*   **Sharing and discussion:**  Openly share findings and encourage dialogue among stakeholders.
*   **Community engagement:**  Involve a wide range of community members in the measurement process.
*   **Ongoing process of repetition:**  Continuously collect and analyze data to monitor progress and adapt strategies.

# Chapter 12: Simplifying Complexity

This chapter of *The Startup Community Way* aims to reconcile the ideas presented in earlier chapters about startup communities as complex adaptive systems with the more straightforward guidance of the Boulder Thesis. The chapter introduces a key principle of startup communities: **"You can’t control a startup community. You can only influence it."** The chapter explores how to apply systems thinking to simplify complexity and influence startup communities. It also revisits the two existing frameworks that can be used to influence startup communities: the Rainforest and the Boulder Thesis.

### The Boulder Thesis

*   The chapter begins by revisiting the **Boulder Thesis**, which was introduced in the authors' previous book, *Startup Communities*. 
*   The authors explain that they have observed some unintended negative side effects of using the Boulder Thesis to build startup communities.
*   The chapter provides the four principles of the Boulder Thesis:

    1.  Entrepreneurs must lead the startup community.
    2.  The leaders must have a long-term commitment.
    3.  The startup community must be inclusive of anyone who wants to participate in it.
    4.  The startup community must have continual activities that engage the entire entrepreneurial stack.
*   The chapter emphasizes the importance of recognizing that startup communities are complex adaptive systems.
*   The authors list several mistakes people make when working with startup communities, many of which stem from a failure to understand the complexities of these systems:
    *   Applying linear systems thinking in a nonlinear world.
    *   Attempting to control a startup community.
    *   Addressing problems in isolation.
    *   Focusing on the parts of a startup community rather than the interactions between them.
    *   Believing that a startup community is formulaic or replicable.
    *   Measuring the wrong things, especially things that are easy to capture but are less important for driving performance.

### The Rainforest

*   The chapter then moves on to discuss **The Rainforest**, another existing framework used to think about building startup communities. 
*   The Rainforest stresses a human-centric focus for improving relationships between people. 
*   The chapter notes that both The Rainforest and the Boulder Thesis, while valuable, can be difficult to use to implement meaningful change.
*   The chapter proposes that **"By focusing entirely on helping entrepreneurs succeed, startup communities and the Boulder Thesis create many immediate areas of focus."**.

### Applying Systems Thinking

*   The chapter transitions to a discussion of **applying systems thinking** to startup communities. 
*   It highlights the importance of remembering that **"Startup communities are propelled by entrepreneurial success and the recycling of those resources back into the next generation."**. Success inspires other entrepreneurs and creates wealth and intangible resources that support future entrepreneurs. 
*   The chapter provides the example of the **Boulder startup community** as a model for success that has inspired other cities.
*   The chapter also stresses that every startup community should focus on building upon its own unique strengths and leveraging its history and local context rather than trying to copy another community like Silicon Valley. 
*   The chapter reinforces that **"Systems improve by changing the connections, not the parts."**.

### Looking Deeply

*   The chapter suggests that people need to **look more deeply** into the systems they are trying to influence to be more effective. 
*   People need to examine the deeper structures that exist "below the surface" to effectively work with complex systems. The chapter uses the **iceberg model of systems thinking** to illustrate this concept. The iceberg model consists of four layers: 
    1.  **Events**: These are the things that happen on the surface and are easily observable. For example, the number of startups or the amount of venture capital invested.
    2.  **Trends/Patterns**: Patterns emerge when you look at the changes in events over time. For example, the growth rate of startups or the types of businesses being funded.
    3.  **Structures**: These are the underlying systems that create the trends and patterns. For example, the laws and policies that govern businesses, the availability of resources, or the cultural norms of the community.
    4.  **Mental Models**: These are the beliefs, values, and assumptions that guide people's actions. They are the most difficult to change, but they are also the most powerful leverage point for influencing a system.
*   The chapter emphasizes that to create change, one must **"work on the whole iceberg, not just the tip of it."**.

### Leverage Points

*   The chapter concludes by examining **leverage points** in complex systems. 
*   It defines leverage points as **"places where small actions—adopted widely and sustained over a period of time—can produce substantial and occasionally predictable changes throughout a complex system"**.
*   The authors provide several examples of leverage points, including **vaccines** and **central bank interest rate adjustments**. 
*   The chapter notes, however, that leverage points are difficult to identify and often work in unexpected ways.  It highlights **Donella Meadows's work on identifying leverage points in complex systems**. 
*   The chapter distills Meadow's 12 leverage points into four categories relevant to startup communities:

    1.  **Physical:** tangible assets and resources, infrastructure.
    2.  **Information:** information flows, data, feedbacks, connectivity.
    3.  **Social:** rules, norms, incentives, goals, system structures.
    4.  **Conscious:** culture, mindset, attitudes, values, worldview.
*   The chapter emphasizes that the most potent levers (social and conscious) are the most difficult to shift because they require people to change how they think and behave.
*   The chapter uses the example of Bill Aulet and the **New Venture Challenge** at MIT to illustrate how to effectively engage with leverage points.
*   The chapter concludes by observing that **"unless the underlying behaviors and attitudes are transformed, connecting people, co-locating them, improving information flows, and collecting better data can only do so much"**. A startup community will only be truly successful if the people within it adopt healthy behaviors and mindsets. 

# Chapter 13: Leadership is Key

This chapter focuses on the **importance of leadership in startup communities, emphasizing that entrepreneurs must be the leaders**. It discusses how leadership based on mentorship and shared learning is crucial for fostering a healthy and thriving startup community. The chapter also highlights the characteristics of effective leaders in these communities.

### Contagion in Complex Systems

* The concept of **contagion**, typically associated with the spread of disease, also applies to the spread of behaviors and attitudes in complex systems like startup communities.
* **Positive behaviors and attitudes, such as mentorship, collaboration, and a willingness to help others, can spread throughout a community, creating a virtuous cycle**.
* Conversely, **negative behaviors, like a lack of trust or a focus on short-term gains, can also spread and have detrimental effects**.
* **Entrepreneurs, as the driving force behind startup communities, play a critical role in shaping the culture and norms of the community**.
* **Their leadership, based on their experiences and the values they embody, can have a significant impact on the overall health and trajectory of the startup community**.

### Be a Mentor 

* **Mentors** are typically **experienced entrepreneurs or individuals with deep expertise in business, industry, or technology**, who also possess the right personality traits to effectively support and guide company founders.
* They must be able to **inspire, challenge, guide, question, be honest and direct, express an eagerness to learn, and, above all, be personally invested in the mentees' success**.
* **Mentorship is a crucial aspect of healthy startup communities, providing guidance and support to new entrepreneurs while fostering a culture of shared learning and collaboration**. 
* **Experienced entrepreneurs are encouraged to embrace the mentorship role** and dedicate time to supporting the next generation of founders.
* This mentorship occurs on multiple levels: **mentoring other entrepreneurs, mentoring future startup community leaders, and mentoring each other**.
* **The most effective mentor relationships are bidirectional, with both the mentor and the mentee learning from each other over time**.
* **Mentorship should be approached with a #GiveFirst dynamic, without expecting anything in return**.

### Entrepreneurs as Role Models 

* **Entrepreneurs serve as role models within the startup community**, demonstrating through their actions the values and behaviors that contribute to success.
* **By embodying a #GiveFirst mindset, actively mentoring others, and exhibiting a commitment to long-term community building, successful entrepreneurs inspire others to follow their lead**. 
* **They help to establish positive norms and a culture of collaboration, making the startup community more attractive to new entrepreneurs and investors**.
* **Their success stories also provide tangible evidence that entrepreneurship is a viable path**, especially in communities where entrepreneurship is not yet widely embraced.

### Key Leadership Characteristics

* Effective leaders in startup communities possess several key characteristics, regardless of their specific leadership style.
* These include:
    * **Commitment**: Demonstrating a long-term commitment to the community and its success.
    * **Responsibility**: Taking responsibility for their actions and their impact on the community.
    * **Transparency**: Being open and honest in their dealings with others.
    * **Humility**: Recognizing that they don't have all the answers and being willing to learn from others.
    * **#GiveFirst Mindset**: A willingness to help others without expecting anything in return.
    * **Focus on Building Relationships**:  Prioritizing the development of strong relationships within the community.
    * **Embrace of Diversity**:  Recognizing the value of diversity and creating an inclusive environment for all participants.

### Tipping Points and Entrepreneurial Leadership

* **Tipping points** are moments when **significant, unstoppable change** occurs in a system after a certain threshold is crossed.
* **This can be positive, like the widespread adoption of helpful behaviors, or negative, like a series of high-profile failures or ethical lapses**. 
* **Entrepreneurial leaders**, through their actions and influence, **can play a crucial role in shifting the balance toward positive tipping points**.
* **By fostering a culture of collaboration, mentorship, and long-term commitment, they can create a more resilient and successful startup community**.
 
This chapter underscores the importance of entrepreneurs as leaders in startup communities. Their leadership, based on mentorship, shared learning, and a #GiveFirst mindset, is crucial for creating a positive and thriving environment for entrepreneurial success. 

# Chapter 14: Think in Generations

This chapter emphasizes the importance of adopting a **long-term perspective** when working with startup communities, recognizing that progress can be uneven and often slow. It encourages patience, persistence, and a commitment to playing the "**endless long-term game**."

### Progress is Uneven and Often Feels Slow

* Building a successful startup community **takes time, often measured in decades rather than years**. This long-term view is essential because the progress is often non-linear and can feel slow, especially in the early stages.
* The chapter underscores that **meaningful change in complex systems, like startup communities, unfolds gradually**. It’s important to avoid the temptation to seek quick fixes or to become discouraged by the lack of immediate, visible results. 
* **Impatience can lead to counterproductive actions**, like chasing fads or trying to force outcomes that are not organically developing. A long-term perspective allows startup community builders to focus on **cultivating the underlying conditions that foster sustainable growth**.

### The Endless Long-Term Game

* The concept of the **"endless long-term game"** emphasizes that building a thriving startup community is a continuous process that requires sustained effort and commitment. There is no finish line.
* **Leaders in startup communities must be willing to play this game over many years, even when facing setbacks or challenges**. Their commitment helps to create stability and continuity, enabling the community to weather fluctuations and emerge stronger in the long run.
* This long-term perspective **allows for experimentation and learning from failures**. By viewing setbacks as opportunities for growth, startup communities can adapt and evolve, becoming more resilient and better equipped to support entrepreneurs.

This chapter also features an example of a leader who embodies the "endless long-term game" mindset. **David Cohen**, a co-founder of Techstars, discusses how he has been involved in building startup communities for over two decades, emphasizing the need for patience and a focus on incremental progress. He stresses the **importance of avoiding shortcuts and celebrating small wins along the way**. Cohen's experience highlights that building a successful startup community is a marathon, not a sprint, and demands unwavering commitment from its leaders.

# Chapter 15: Diversity is a Feature, Not a Bug

This chapter of *The Startup Community Way: Evolving an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem* emphasizes the crucial role of diversity in startup communities. It argues that diversity, extending beyond just identity, is essential for fostering innovation, creativity, and the dynamic interactions that drive successful outcomes. The authors encourage a broad understanding of diversity, encompassing a range of perspectives, experiences, and approaches to problem-solving. 

### Cultivate Diversity 

Diversity is **not just a moral imperative**, but a **practical necessity for building a thriving startup community**. Complex systems, like startup ecosystems, thrive on diversity as it fuels the **synergies** and **nonlinearity** that contribute to a system being greater than the sum of its parts. A **lack of diversity** can lead to **groupthink** and a **limited range of ideas**, hindering the ability of the community to adapt to new challenges and opportunities. 

### Embracing Diversity

**Identity diversity**, encompassing differences in gender, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, age, socioeconomic background, and geographic origin, is crucial for reasons of morality and fairness. The authors acknowledge their privileged position and advocate for equality and diversity, recognizing that they cannot fully understand the experiences of those from less privileged backgrounds. They encourage a **broader view of diversity**, encompassing **cognitive diversity** which includes variations in thought processes, problem-solving approaches, risk tolerance, educational background, and professional experiences.  

#### Ulu Ventures Example

Ulu Ventures, a venture capital firm discussed in this chapter, embraces diversity as a core principle and investment thesis. They contend that diversity, particularly **cognitive diversity**, leads to **superior financial performance**. 

Ulu Ventures employs several practices to promote and leverage diversity:

1.  **Mentoring:** Recognizing that the venture capital world is predominantly white and male, Ulu Ventures actively mentors entrepreneurs from diverse backgrounds, helping them navigate the startup ecosystem and communicate their ideas effectively to investors. 
2. **Intentional Outreach:** Ulu Ventures goes beyond traditional networking channels to connect with entrepreneurs from underrepresented groups. They understand that relying solely on existing networks can perpetuate existing biases and limit access to diverse perspectives.
3. **Decision Analysis and Market Mapping:** They help entrepreneurs from diverse backgrounds develop their investor-speak skills and construct compelling narratives by using data-driven tools to understand and articulate their market opportunity. Ulu Ventures uses decision analysis to help founders break down a problem into its component parts, assign probabilities, and run scenarios based on assumptions. They use market mapping to create a visual and quantitative representation of how founders will pursue their market and where they fit within the competitive landscape. This approach allows entrepreneurs to communicate their ideas and demonstrate their understanding of the market to potential investors. 
4. **Transparency and Accessibility:**  Ulu Ventures is transparent about their investment process and decision criteria and provides entrepreneurs with detailed feedback reports. This approach helps to demystify the venture capital process and empower entrepreneurs to refine their pitches and strategies.

### Think Broadly about Entrepreneurship

The authors emphasize the need to expand the definition of entrepreneurship beyond the traditional model of starting and scaling high-growth companies.  **Embracing a broader understanding of entrepreneurship** can unlock the potential of individuals from diverse backgrounds, leading to more innovative solutions and a more inclusive economy. They suggest that **applying an entrepreneurial mindset**, which involves **identifying opportunities, taking calculated risks, and being adaptable to change**, can be valuable in various contexts, including social enterprises, non-profit organizations, and even within large corporations. 

# Chapter 16: Be Active, Not Passive

This chapter advocates for an active approach to startup community building. It emphasizes that waiting for permission or relying on top-down initiatives is ineffective in complex systems like startup communities.  The chapter encourages individuals to take initiative, embrace a positive-sum game, and continuously engage with the community. 

### Self-Similarity and Replication

* Successful patterns and practices from one startup community can inspire and inform others, but direct replication is unlikely to be effective. 
* **Each startup community is unique**, shaped by its own history, culture, and resources.
*  Attempting to copy a successful model from another location often leads to disappointment and frustration.
* Instead of replication, focus on **adaptation and customization**, drawing inspiration from successful patterns while tailoring them to the specific context of your community. 

### Don’t Wait or Ask Permission 

* **Entrepreneurs are known for their bias toward action** and their willingness to take risks. This proactive spirit is essential for driving progress in startup communities.
* **Waiting for someone else to take the lead** or seeking permission from authority figures can stifle initiative and slow down momentum.
* Embrace a **bottom-up approach**, where individuals take ownership and drive initiatives without waiting for a top-down directive.
* The **Young Entrepreneurs Organization (YEO)** is cited as an example of a successful organization that emerged from entrepreneurs taking initiative without seeking permission .

### Play a Positive-Sum Game

* **Startup communities thrive on collaboration and a spirit of abundance**, where individuals believe that everyone can benefit from the success of others.
*  A **positive-sum game** mindset fosters trust, encourages knowledge sharing, and creates a more supportive environment for entrepreneurs. 
* Conversely, a **zero-sum game** mentality, where individuals view success as limited and compete for scarce resources, can be detrimental to a startup community.
* The principle of **#GiveFirst** embodies this positive-sum approach, encouraging individuals to contribute to the community without expecting immediate returns. 

### Continuously and Actively Engage

* Building a vibrant startup community requires **ongoing effort and engagement** from all participants.
* **Passivity** can lead to stagnation, allowing momentum to fade and potentially leading to the decline of the community . 
* Encourage **regular participation in events, mentorship, and knowledge sharing** to maintain a dynamic and supportive environment .
*  **Celebrate successes** and **learn from failures** to foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement.

This chapter underscores the importance of individual initiative and active participation in building successful startup communities. It encourages individuals to take ownership, embrace a collaborative mindset, and contribute to the community's growth through consistent engagement.  

# Chapter 17: Conclusion
