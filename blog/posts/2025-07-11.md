### 1. Chuck Akre, Akre Capital Management 

**Bio:** Chuck Akre is a veteran value investor renowned for his "three-legged stool" investment philosophy. This framework prioritizes businesses with exceptional management, high returns on capital, and significant reinvestment opportunities. He founded Akre Capital Management in 1989 and is known for his long-term, concentrated investment approach, often holding companies for many years. 

**Investment Philosophy:** Akre's strategy can be described as investing in "compounding machines." He focuses on identifying high-quality businesses with durable competitive advantages, often referred to as "economic moats." Unlike traditional value investors who may focus on statistically cheap stocks, Akre is willing to pay a fair price for an exceptional business with strong growth potential. His firm is known for its low turnover, reflecting a patient, long-term perspective. 

**Recent Trades (as of Q1 2025):** 

*   **Holdings Value:** Akre Capital Management's 13F portfolio value was approximately $10.4 billion. 
*   **New Positions:** No new positions were initiated in the most recent quarter. 
*   **Increased Stakes:** The firm added to its positions in Brookfield Corp. (BN), Airbnb (ABNB), and CCC Intelligent Solutions (CCCS). 
*   **Decreased Stakes:** Akre trimmed positions in several long-term winners, including Mastercard (MA), O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), Moody's (MCO), and Visa (V). This appears to be a case of harvesting gains in highly appreciated holdings. 
*   **Significant Holdings:** The top five holdings in the portfolio were Mastercard, O'Reilly Automotive, Moody's, Visa, and KKR, accounting for roughly 61% of the portfolio's value. 

**Recent Talks and Insights:** In recent discussions, Akre has continued to emphasize the importance of focusing on business fundamentals rather than short-term market fluctuations. He advises investors to avoid getting caught up in market trends and instead concentrate on identifying exceptional companies trading at reasonable prices. His core message remains consistent: invest in high-quality businesses with enduring competitive advantages and let the power of compounding work over the long term. 

### 2. Dennis Hong, ShawSpring Partners 

**Bio:** Dennis Hong is the founder and portfolio manager of ShawSpring Partners. A Yale University graduate, he launched the firm in 2014 after working at other prominent investment firms.

**Investment Philosophy:** Hong's investment strategy focuses on high-growth businesses with durable competitive advantages and strong alignment between management and shareholders. He takes a long-term perspective and is willing to hold investments for many years to allow for compounding. His firm primarily invests in the technology, internet, and consumer sectors globally. 

**Recent Activity:** Specific recent trades for ShawSpring Partners are not as readily available in public filings due to the nature of their reporting. However, Hong has been active in sharing his investment philosophy. 

**Recent Talks and Insights:** In recent interviews, Hong has spoken about the importance of building a "world-class partnership" based on seeking exceptional returns and a commitment to long-term compounding. He emphasizes the significance of having a strong relationship with the management of the companies he invests in. For young investors, he recommends gaining exposure to as many companies as possible to build pattern recognition and to focus on understanding the underlying business dynamics. 

### 3. Pat Dorsey, Dorsey Asset Management 

**Bio:** Pat Dorsey is a renowned expert on "economic moats," a concept he helped popularize during his time as the Director of Equity Research at Morningstar. He is the founder of Dorsey Asset Management, where he employs a moat-focused, long-term investment strategy. 

**Investment Philosophy:** Dorsey's investment approach is a blend of growth and value investing, with a strong emphasis on identifying companies with durable competitive advantages. He seeks to buy these "moated" businesses at fair prices and hold them for the long term. The four primary sources of economic moats he identifies are intangible assets, high switching costs, network effects, and cost advantages. 

**Recent Trades:** Detailed quarterly trades for Dorsey Asset Management are not always publicly available. However, his largest reported holdings include Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet (GOOG). 

**Recent Talks and Insights:** In recent talks and writings, Dorsey continues to elaborate on the concept of economic moats. He cautions investors against mistaking strong brands or market share for a true moat. A key indicator of a moat, he suggests, is a company's ability to consistently raise prices without losing customers. He stresses that while capitalism is effective at eroding high returns on capital, companies with genuine moats can defy this trend for extended periods. 

### 4. Josh Tarasoff, Greenlea Lane Capital 

**Bio:** Josh Tarasoff is the founder and General Partner of Greenlea Lane Capital, a private investment partnership he established in 2006. He is known for his independent and highly concentrated investment approach, running a "self-driving" portfolio. 

**Investment Philosophy:** Tarasoff's strategy is characterized by extreme selectivity and a long-term, permanent holding period. He focuses on businesses with strong fundamentals, sustainable advantages, and honest management. A key differentiator in his approach is his willingness to invest in companies driving predictable change, such as the shift to online retail or cloud computing, which he believes can be as certain as the consistency sought by traditional value investors. He is comfortable with companies that may not appear statistically cheap but have the potential for significant long-term value creation. 

**Recent Activity:** Specific recent trades for Greenlea Lane Capital are not publicly disclosed. 

**Recent Talks and Insights:** In recent interviews and essays, Tarasoff has discussed his concept of a "self-driving portfolio," which aims for an infinite time horizon. He believes that this long-term perspective improves decision-making. He also emphasizes the importance of a "mission-driven culture" as a key indicator of a quality company. Tarasoff's approach is a departure from the typical investment firm model; he operates with a lean team and without a formal office, allowing him to focus on his core investment activity. 

### 5. Glenn Welling, Engaged Capital 

**Bio:** Glenn Welling is the founder and CIO of Engaged Capital, an activist investment firm that primarily focuses on small and mid-cap companies. Welling has a background in private equity and has been involved in numerous activist campaigns aimed at unlocking shareholder value.

Their focus is on undervalued companies where they see a path to operational or strategic improvements.

**Bio:** Bruce Berkowitz is the founder and Chief Investment Officer of Fairholme Capital Management. He is a deep-value, contrarian investor known for his highly concentrated and often unconventional investment bets. He was named Morningstar's Domestic-Stock Fund Manager of the Decade for 2000-2009. 

**Investment Philosophy:** Berkowitz's strategy revolves around buying unpopular assets at a deep discount to their intrinsic value. He is not afraid to take large, concentrated positions in out-of-favor sectors.

**Recent Talks and Insights:** Pabrai continues to be a vocal advocate for his cloning strategy, arguing that it is a powerful and underutilized tool for individual investors.

He has also shared his "10 Commandments of Investing," which distill his value-oriented approach.

### 11. Norbert Lou, Punch Card Management

**Bio:** Norbert Lou is the founder of Punch Card Management, an investment firm whose name is a direct nod to Warren Buffett's famous "20-slot punch card" analogy for selective, high-conviction investing. Lou maintains a low public profile, letting the firm's concentrated portfolio speak for itself.

**Investment Philosophy:** Punch Card Management embodies an ultra-concentrated, long-term investment strategy. The philosophy is to invest in a very small number of exceptional businesses that the firm understands deeply and believes can compound capital at high rates over many years.

### 18. Christopher Davis, Davis Advisors

**Bio:** Christopher Davis is the Chairman of Davis Advisors, a third-generation investment management firm founded by his grandfather. He has managed the firm’s flagship Davis New York Venture Fund for decades, carrying on a long family tradition of value investing.

**Bio:** Bill Nygren is a veteran value investor and the portfolio manager of the Oakmark Fund and Oakmark Select Fund. He has been with Harris Associates, the adviser to the Oakmark Funds, since 1983. Nygren is a highly regarded figure in the value investing community, known for his thoughtful and consistent approach.

**Investment Philosophy:** Nygren's definition of value investing is broad and pragmatic. He seeks to buy businesses at a significant discount to their intrinsic value, which he defines as what a rational businessperson would pay to own the entire company.

He is comfortable investing in areas often overlooked by traditional value investors, such as growth-oriented technology companies.

**Recent Talks and Insights:** In his quarterly commentaries and interviews, Nygren has recently discussed the attractive valuations he sees in the financial sector, particularly well-capitalized banks. He has also argued that companies like Alphabet and Meta are "value stocks" based on their prodigious free cash flow and dominant market positions, even if they don't screen as cheap on traditional metrics like price-to-book. He emphasizes that the definition of a "value" investment should evolve with the economy.

### 23. Bill Miller, Miller Value Partners

**Bio:** Bill Miller is a legendary and often contrarian value investor. He is the founder and Chief Investment Officer of Miller Value Partners. He is most famous for his record-setting streak of beating the S&P 500 for 15 consecutive years (1991-2005) while managing the Legg Mason Value Trust.

**Investment Philosophy:** Miller's approach to value investing is unconventional. He defines a value investment as any stock trading at a discount to its intrinsic value, regardless of its industry or growth characteristics. This has led him to invest in technology companies like Amazon and Dell early on, long before they were considered "value" plays by the broader market. He is known for making high-conviction, concentrated bets and holding them through volatility.

**Recent Trades (as of Q1 2025):**

**Recent Talks and Insights:** In his market letters, Bill Miller has maintained a bullish long-term outlook, arguing that innovation and economic growth will ultimately prevail.

**Investment Philosophy:** Chou is a quintessential Graham-and-Dodd value investor. He seeks to buy securities at a fraction of their tangible asset value or conservatively calculated intrinsic value, demanding a deep margin of safety.

His primary goal is to achieve equity-like returns over the long term while minimizing the risk of permanent capital loss.

**Recent Talks and Insights:** Nick Train provides extensive commentary through his monthly fund factsheets and interviews. He consistently discusses the power of enduring brands and the importance of taking a truly long-term view.
