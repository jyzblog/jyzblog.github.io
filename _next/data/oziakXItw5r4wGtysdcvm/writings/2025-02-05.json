{"pageProps":{"content":"# Notes - Hacking Growth\n*February 4, 2025*\n# Chapter 1: Building Growth Teams\n\nThe authors, Sean Ellis and Morgan Brown, begin by stating that the growth hacking method detailed in the book has been the engine behind the success of many of the fastest-growing Silicon Valley companies such as Pinterest, BitTorrent, Uber, and LinkedIn. The authors challenge the popular notion that these companies' success was due to a single brilliant idea, stating that it was actually achieved through methodical and rapid experimentation and analysis of user data.\n\nThe core elements of the growth hacking method include:\n\n* The formation of cross-functional teams that combine marketing and product development talents.\n* The use of qualitative research and quantitative data analysis to understand user behavior and preferences.\n* The rapid generation and testing of ideas, using metrics to evaluate results.\n\nDespite the effectiveness of growth hacking, there has not been a definitive guide for practitioners, which this book aims to address. The authors emphasize that growth hacking is a fundamental new approach to market development that is not yet well understood. Sean Ellis, one of the leading innovators of the practice, is also the founder of GrowthHackers.com, a popular resource for information on the subject. The authors aim to provide a practical, step-by-step guide for implementing growth hacking in any company. The book is presented as a \"playbook\" that draws on the authors' experiences as well as the wisdom of other experts.\n\nThe book is divided into two parts:\n\n* **Part I: \"The Method\"** introduces the growth hacking process, explaining how to set up growth teams, manage them, and use the high-tempo growth hacking process to generate ideas and testing. It provides a business case for implementing this method.\n* **Part II: \"The Growth Hacking Playbook\"** offers specific tactics for acquiring, activating, retaining, and monetizing users, as well as sustaining growth. It includes stories of growth teams from various companies and industries. The authors also provide links to online tools such as GrowthHackers Projects, customer survey tools, templates for prioritizing hacks, and guidelines for running growth meetings.\n\nThe authors emphasize that growth hacking is a methodology that can be implemented by businesses of all sizes and in every industry. It is a data-driven approach that helps companies systematically use their data. Growth hacking is presented as essential for any company that wishes to achieve business goals with limited investment and maximum return on marketing dollars.\n\nA collaborative approach between different departments is crucial for growth, but is not always the norm in many companies. Siloing business units can hinder innovation and slow growth. While research shows that collaboration is more important than individual talent for innovation, only a small percentage of senior executives consider their organizations effective at sharing knowledge across boundaries.\n\nThe role of the **growth lead** is discussed in detail. This role involves being a manager, product owner, and scientist. A growth lead is responsible for choosing the core focus area and objectives for the team. This focus helps to optimize results by preventing the team from pursuing ideas that don't contribute to their stated goal. The growth lead also ensures that the team is tracking the right metrics to measure and improve growth. Many companies focus on vanity metrics rather than metrics that indicate actual growth. A growth lead needs skills in data analysis, product management, and experiment design. They should also have familiarity with methods for growing adoption of the type of product they are working on as well as strong leadership skills to keep the team focused. The role is demanding, but with the proper tools and methods, it can be managed efficiently.\n\nThe book also outlines the role of a **product manager** on a growth team. Product managers oversee how the product and its features are developed. They are essentially the \"CEO of the product\".\n\nThe importance of **data analysis** is stressed. Data analysis should not be outsourced but should be a core function of the growth team. Companies should not rely too heavily on prepackaged programs with limited capacity to combine data and make discoveries. A skilled data analyst can be crucial for a growth team’s success.\n\nTeam members take on specialty tasks based on their area of expertise. For example, engineers will handle coding, designers will create design elements, data analysts will select the users for tests, and marketers will implement promotional experiments. User experience designers may collect and evaluate user feedback, which can lead to ideas for product changes.\n\nThe book underscores that growth teams need **executive sponsorship** to have the authority to cross departmental responsibilities. Without commitment from leadership, growth teams will face bureaucracy and inefficiency. Start-ups should have the founder or CEO leading growth, or have the teams report directly to them. In larger companies, teams should report to a high-level executive.\n\nTwo common **reporting structures** for growth teams are introduced: the functional (or product-led) model, where teams report to a product management executive, and the marketing-led model. A product-led team might focus on growing the user base for a specific product, or improving one aspect of the product, such as the onboarding process. For instance, at Pinterest, a growth team is dedicated to optimizing email messages and mobile push notifications.\n\nThe book explains how growth teams can ease tensions between different departments by ensuring that decisions are based on data rather than assumptions. **Data-driven experimentation** is crucial to overcome the \"lore\" that can hold back growth. At Qualaroo, for example, growth was previously limited by the belief that prices could not be raised; however, data showed that prices could be raised significantly while still attracting a new clientele.\n\nBringing in outside experts who specialize in user growth can be beneficial for smaller teams. However, the core responsibility for growth should not be outsourced. Consultants often lack the authority, time, or motivation to achieve sustainable growth.\n\nThe authors stress the importance of ensuring that a product is truly a \"must-have\" before focusing on growth. Spending resources on promoting a product that no one wants can be detrimental. It is also important to remember that word-of-mouth can be a double-edged sword.\n\nA common misconception about growth hacking is that it is primarily about building virality into products. While virality is a key tactic, it should only be deployed after the product has been deemed a must-have. Growth teams need to use rigorous methods to understand user behavior and discover the core value of their product. The core value of a product may not be what the creators originally envisioned, and it's up to the growth team to discover it.\n\n# Chapter 2: Determining If Your Product Is Must-Have\n\nThis chapter focuses on determining whether a product has achieved \"must-have\" status, which is essential for sustainable growth. The authors argue that a product must provide core value and elicit an \"aha moment\" for users to become loyal and for a company to achieve rapid, sustainable growth. Without this, marketing and virality efforts are ineffective.\n\n**The \"Must-Have\" Test**: The authors present a two-pronged approach to assessing whether a product is \"must-have\":\n\n* **The Must-Have Survey:** This survey gauges users' reactions if the product were discontinued. The key question to ask is \"How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?\". The possible answers are \"very disappointed\", \"somewhat disappointed\", or \"not disappointed\". A significant portion of users selecting \"very disappointed\" indicates that the product has achieved \"must-have\" status. The authors caution that this survey should not be used beyond the initial stage of assessing product value, as suggesting that a product might be discontinued can cause panic.\n* **Retention Rate:** This measures the number of users who continue using the product over time. A stable and high retention rate, compared to competitors, is a crucial indicator of a product's \"must-have\" status. Teams should track churn rates weekly or monthly to identify defections early.\n\n**Importance of the \"Aha Moment\"**: The \"aha moment\" is when users experience the core value of a product. The authors emphasize that identifying the core value is not always straightforward and may differ from the initial product vision. Sometimes, a valuable feature may be an afterthought or something quite different from the originally hypothesized core value. It's the growth team's job to discover this. Companies should also ensure that users experience the \"aha moment\" as quickly as possible.\n\n**What to do if a product is not \"must-have\"**:\n\n* **Avoid Guesswork**: The authors advise against making assumptions about what will make a product more appealing. Instead, they recommend deeper user engagement to understand barriers to success.\n* **Talk to users**: The authors suggest talking to users, through interviews or surveys to understand their objections and barriers, instead of guessing solutions.\n* **Don’t add features blindly**: The authors warn against \"feature creep,\" which is adding features that don't create core value, making products cumbersome and confusing to use. Improvement sometimes comes from removing features rather than adding them.\n\n**Methods for discovering core value**: The chapter suggests three methods to determine why the \"aha moment\" hasn't been achieved:\n\n* **Customer Surveys and Interviews**: Marketing and product design specialists conduct these to understand customer objections. This involves going out and talking to customers and prospective customers to gain deeper insights.\n* **Experimental Testing**: Engineers set up tests to evaluate product changes and messaging.\n* **Data Analysis**: Data analysts examine user behavior to find patterns and insights that are not obvious through basic metrics. They also look for features used by avid users and any distinctive behaviors. They emphasize the importance of collecting the right data, connecting different data sources, and having a data analyst to mine that data for insights.\n\n**Data Analysis and Metrics**: The authors emphasize that data analysis is crucial for understanding customer behavior and identifying opportunities for improvement. They criticize companies that rely too heavily on prepackaged programs like Google Analytics, which have limited capacity for combining data. They also warn against focusing on surface-level metrics and emphasize the need for a data analyst who can mine data for valuable insights. The goal is to identify behaviors that differentiate users who find the product \"must-have\" from those who don't. By analyzing the features most used by avid users and distinctive aspects of their behavior the team can identify correlations with higher engagement, purchases, and long-term use.\n\n**Product/Market Fit**: Making a product compelling enough to pass the \"must-have\" test is a prerequisite for fast and sustainable growth, but not sufficient. Even great products will likely fail without a well-focused strategy to drive growth. Many products fail because they do not offer a compelling core product value to a large enough market beyond early adopters or they lack a well-designed strategy for growth.\n\n# Chapter 3: Identifying Your Growth Levers\n\nThe third chapter of \"Hacking Growth\" focuses on identifying and understanding the key metrics that drive a company's growth. It emphasizes that while common metrics are valuable, each business must determine its own unique set of growth levers. The chapter also discusses the importance of using data to gain insights into user behavior.\n\n**Fundamental Growth Equation**\nThe core concept of this chapter is the **\"fundamental growth equation,\"** a simple formula that represents all the key factors that combine to drive growth for a specific company. This equation is unique to every product and business. It helps growth teams focus on the most critical signals amid a sea of data.\n\n* For example, for a subscription business like Inman News, the equation might be: *Number of Leads x Lead to Customer Rate x Average Customer Lifetime Value = Growth*.\n* For Uber, key metrics include the number of drivers and the number of riders.\n* For Yelp, the core factors are the number of businesses reviewed and the number of reviews per business.\n* For Facebook, key factors include the amount of content shared by users and time spent browsing the News Feed.\n\nWhile all products share some common growth drivers like user acquisition, activation, and retention, the specific combination of factors that drives growth is unique to each business.\n**Determining Essential Metrics**\nTo identify these essential metrics, a business should pinpoint the actions that most directly correlate with users experiencing the core value of the product. For example, for Facebook, this includes how many people a user invites to join their friend circle, how often they visit the site, and how much they post and comment. For Uber, an essential metric for riders is the number of rides completed.\n\nIt's crucial to track metrics for each step users must take to reach the \"aha moment\" and how often they are taking those steps. Companies should track not only the number of new users downloading an app, but also the number of rides being booked, the number of riders who return and rebook, and the frequency with which they are booking new rides.\n\n**Moving Beyond Basic Analytics**\nWhile basic analytics like website visits and page views are important, they are not sufficient to reveal deeper insights. Metrics tracked through traditional marketing and prepackaged data dashboards, such as web visitors, page views, new and returning users, new sign-ups, and time spent on the website, are valuable, but it is more important to identify the specific metrics unique to the product.\n\nThe key mission at this stage is to differentiate the behaviors of customers who find the product \"must-have\" from those who do not. Analysts should look for features most used by avid users and other distinctive aspects of their behavior. By dividing customer data by attributes like demographics, job title, or mobile device, and examining how users are engaging with the product, correlations between attributes and behavior and greater levels of purchasing, higher engagement, and longer-term use can be found. For example, Netflix identified that customers who watched Kevin Spacey movies also had high engagement with the product.\n\n**Data Analysis and Experimentation**\nGrowth teams need to systematically track data on user behavior. Many companies focus on vanity metrics, such as the number of website visitors, which do not indicate actual growth. Instead, growth teams should focus on metrics that are directly related to product usage and revenue generation.\n\nThe chapter also stresses the importance of combining all data sources to track customers throughout the entire experience. It highlights the need for a data analyst who can delve into the data to make discoveries. Simply reviewing data from prepackaged programs is not enough, it is also important to connect various data pools. A standout data analyst can be the difference between a growth team wasting time and finding valuable insights.\n\n**Importance of a Unified Data Store**\nA unified data store helps identify areas for experimentation and design better experiments focused on improving key growth levers. The Facebook growth team stopped all growth experiments for a month in 2009 to focus on improving their data tracking and collection. After this project, they could see what each user was doing, allowing them to create more focused experiments. Smaller companies can more easily combine their data thanks to the availability of tools and services.\n\n**Limitations of Data and Importance of Qualitative Research**\nThe author notes that even detailed data has limits. Data analysis can tell you what users are doing, but not why they are behaving that way. To understand the \"why,\" it is important to conduct user surveys or interviews. For example, if many users are leaving a website when trying to use a certain feature, it may be due to usability issues, but further user research would be needed to understand the underlying causes.\n\n**Accessible Reporting**\nThe chapter emphasizes the importance of reporting data findings in an accessible way. Even if the right metrics are tracked and analyzed, the results won’t lead to action if the team can’t understand them. Visual dashboards can help team members focus on key trends and metrics. These dashboards make it easier to share findings with the company, encouraging more participation in the growth effort. The author notes the importance of focusing team members’ attention on key trends and metrics using dashboards. The author also recommends sharing data in a way that is judicious and keeping in mind which reports are sent out beyond the growth team. The reports should be insightful and actionable, rather than just “data puking.”\n\nDashboards should report only on the most important metrics that map to growth levers. Metrics should be presented as ratios rather than static numbers, and they should be accompanied by indicators showing if they are above, below, or on par with past performance.\n\n**Case Study: Twitter**\nThe chapter uses Twitter as an example of how identifying growth levers, conducting in-depth analysis, and supplementing it with customer queries can optimize growth. The growth team discovered that users who followed at least 30 other users became long-term fans. The team used cohort analysis to divide users into groups by common traits, like the month they joined. This led to the discovery that users who followed 30 or more accounts were more active and engaged with the platform. Twitter then refined its ways of suggesting people for users to follow.\n\n# Chapter 4: Testing at High Tempo\n\nThis chapter focuses on how to run rapid-fire experiments to achieve compounding wins. The volume and pace of experiments will vary depending on company size and resources, but it is crucial to have a disciplined process to create a pipeline of ideas and prioritize them efficiently. This helps to ensure continuous testing without errors in execution or getting bogged down in brainstorming.\n\nThe authors have developed a four-part cycle with simple tools to ensure that a growth team operates as a fast-tempo experimenting machine.\n\n### The Growth Hacking Cycle\n\nThe growth hacking cycle includes data analysis and insight gathering, idea generation, experiment prioritization, running the experiments, and then analyzing the results and deciding on next steps in a continuous loop. This cycle should be completed consistently, preferably every one or two weeks, and is managed by a weekly one-hour growth team meeting.\n\n### Preparing for Liftoff\n\nBefore launching into the cycle, an initial team meeting is required to explain the process. The growth lead should clarify the roles and expectations of each team member. The methods for generating and prioritizing ideas should be explained, and the data analyst should share the results of initial analysis. The growth lead should present the key growth levers, the North Star metric, and the area of focus for the team. The team should set the goal for the volume and tempo of experiments to launch each week and data analysts and engineers are best suited to make initial assessments.\n\n### Generating Ideas\n\nOver four days following the team meeting, all members should submit as many ideas as possible for hacks, even if they seem crazy. Team members should contribute ideas based on their expertise but not be limited by it. For example, a user experience designer might propose changes to screen displays, while a marketing member might focus on different ways to encourage users to make their first purchase, and engineers might come up with ideas to enhance product performance.\n\nEach idea should include a detailed description and a hypothesis.\n\n* **Idea Description**: Like an executive summary, it should address the who, what, where, when, why, and how of the idea.\n  * Who is being targeted? For example, all visitors, new users only, returning users, or users from a particular traffic source.\n  * What is going to be created, such as new marketing copy or a new feature?\n  * Where will the new copy or feature be implemented, such as on the app’s home screen or elsewhere?\n  * When will it appear during the customer’s use, such as on the landing page when a visitor first comes to the site?\n  * The description must include the rationale behind the idea and a recommendation of the type of test to be done, such as an A/B test, new feature to be built, or a new ad campaign.\n* **Hypothesis**: A simple proposition of expected cause and effect. For example, \"By making it easier for shoppers to view and reorder previously purchased items, the number of people who make repeat purchases will increase by 20 percent\".\n\n### Prioritizing Ideas\n\nThe authors recommend using a scoring system to prioritize ideas, assessing impact, confidence, and ease of implementation.\n\n* **Impact** is the potential impact the idea could have on the key metric.\n* **Confidence** is the certainty the team has that the test will work.\n* **Ease** represents how difficult the experiment will be to implement.\n\nThe growth lead reviews the initial scores before the team meeting and may suggest modifications based on past experience. The team should use the score as a guide, not as the absolute rule for test prioritization. The growth lead must act decisively to keep the team moving.\n\n### Testing Rules of the Road\n\nEach experiment has an opportunity cost, so the idea selection and testing method are important. A poor test means a lost opportunity, and bad data can lead the team down the wrong path. It's essential that every experiment produce statistically valid results. The data analyst is responsible for applying testing rules. The authors recommend two rules of thumb:\n\n* **Use a 99 percent statistical confidence level**: A 95% confidence level means a winning test can still be wrong 5% of the time, while a 99% confidence level reduces the risk of false positives to 1 out of 100.\n* **Always have a control group**: Each test group should be compared to a control group that is not being subjected to a change. This helps ensure that results are due to the test rather than other variables.\n\n### Analyzing Results\n\nAnalysis of test results should be conducted by the analyst or the growth lead. Results should be written up in a test summary that includes:\n\n* The name and description of the test including the variants used and the target customers.\n* The type of test, such as a product function test or a marketing copy change.\n* The key metrics tracked.\n* Potential confounding issues that may have skewed results.\n* The conclusions drawn.\n\nThis summary should be shared with the growth team via email and added to a database of test summaries. This database, called the knowledge base, should be easily searchable for teams to revisit and consider variations.\n\n### The Weekly Growth Meeting\n\nThe weekly growth meeting is a one-hour meeting that helps manage the growth hacking cycle.\n\n* **15 minutes: Metrics Review and Update Focus Area**: The growth lead reviews the latest data for the North Star metric and other key growth metrics, highlighting what is working and what needs improvement.\n* **10 minutes: Review Last Week's Testing Activity**: The team assesses the tempo of experiments launched in the previous week and identifies why any tests were delayed.\n* **15 minutes: Key Lessons Learned from Analyzed Experiments**: The growth lead, data analyst, and experiment owners review the preliminary and conclusive results from tests, answer questions, take suggestions, and determine the implications for further action.\n* **20 minutes: Decide the Next Set of Experiments**: The team reviews the prioritized list of ideas, the growth lead makes the final call on which experiments to run, and team members take ownership of the experiments they will manage.\n\n# Chapter 5: Testing at High Tempo\n\nThis chapter discusses how to run rapid-fire experiments to produce compounding wins. The chapter emphasizes that big successes in growth hacking come from a series of small wins that accumulate over time. Each learning leads to better performance and ideas, which in turn leads to more wins.\n\n### Tempo Picks Up Over Time\n\nThe volume of experiments a growth team can run depends on the size of the company and resources. Leading growth teams may run 20 to 30 experiments a week or more, while early-stage startups may launch only one or two tests a week. Regardless of the company size, a disciplined process is crucial to maximize the number of experiments and gains. This process ensures continuous testing without sloppy execution, invalid results, or getting bogged down in debates about which ideas to try.\n\n### The Growth Hacking Cycle\n\nThe authors have developed a four-part cycle with tools to help a growth team operate as a fast-tempo experimenting machine. The stages of this process include:\n\n* Data analysis and insight gathering\n* Idea generation\n* Experiment prioritization\n* Running the experiments\n  The cycle is continuous, and each turn should be completed on a consistent interval, preferably in one or two weeks. At GrowthHackers, they use a one-week cycle. A one-hour weekly growth team meeting is used to review results and agree on the next week’s experiments.\n\n### Preparing for Liftoff\n\nBefore starting the cycle, an initial team meeting should be held to explain the process. The growth lead clarifies each team member's role and how they are expected to work collaboratively. The methods for generating and prioritizing ideas are also explained. The data analyst should share the results of their initial analysis, and the growth lead presents the key growth levers, the North Star metric, and the team's focus area. The team should also set a goal for the volume of experiments they can manage weekly.\n\n### Example of a Growth Hacking Cycle\n\nThe chapter provides an example of a grocery app team that goes through the first stages of this cycle. The data analyst summarizes user data, while the marketing expert conducts user surveys and interviews. The growth lead then writes a summary highlighting the shared characteristics of regular shoppers versus those who have not made many purchases. The team members are tasked with contributing ideas for hacks to improve revenue from app users, and all ideas are considered.\n\n### Idea Submission\n\nIdeas should be submitted with a brief name, a description that addresses the \"who, what, where, when, why, and how\" of the idea, and a hypothesis of the expected outcome. The product manager of the grocery app team comes up with the idea to build a \"shopping list\" feature to store prior purchases for easy reordering. The description explains who the feature is for, what will be created, where it will be implemented, when it will appear, the rationale behind the idea, and a recommendation of the test to be done. The hypothesis for the shopping list feature could be: \"By making it easier for shoppers to view and reorder previously purchased items, the number of people who make repeat purchases will increase by 20 percent.\"\n\n### Prioritization\n\nThe submitted ideas are scored based on their potential impact, confidence, and ease of implementation. The growth lead reviews the initial scores and may suggest modifications based on their experience. It’s important not to get bogged down in trying to fine-tune the score; it serves as a guide for prioritization.\n\n### Testing Rules of the Road\n\nEach experiment comes at the expense of another, so care must be taken in the selection of an idea and how it is tested. A poor test slows the team down, and bad data can lead the team down the wrong path. Every experiment must be designed to produce statistically valid results. The data analyst is responsible for applying these rules to experiments. The chapter notes two rules of thumb: (1) keep tests simple, with one variable, and (2) avoid changes that are too complex to be easily understood or replicated.\n\n### Back to Stage 1: Analysis and Learning\n\nThe analysis of test results is conducted by the analyst or the growth lead. The results are written in a test summary that includes:\n\n* The name and description of the test\n* The type of test run\n* The metrics used for the test\n* Potential confounding issues\n* The conclusions drawn\n  This summary should be shared with the team and added to a knowledge base for future reference. The results of all experiments should be easily searchable for the team.\n\n### The Weekly Growth Meeting\n\nA weekly one-hour growth meeting should follow a standard agenda and is managed by the growth lead. This agenda should include:\n\n* **Metrics Review and Update Focus Area** (15 minutes): The growth lead reviews the latest data for the North Star metric and other key metrics.\n* **Review of Last Week's Testing Activity** (10 minutes): The team reviews the number of experiments launched in the previous week compared to the goal, and they also discuss why tests were delayed.\n* **Key Lessons Learned from Analyzed Experiments** (15 minutes): The growth lead and data analyst go over the preliminary and conclusive results from tests, and the team makes suggestions for further analysis.\n* **Next Week's Experiments** (20 minutes): The team chooses the most promising ideas for the next week based on scores and new insights.\n\nThe team compiles this information with the meeting agenda and shares it beforehand, with the growth lead responsible for keeping the team on track.\n\n# Chapter 6: Hacking Activation\n\nThis chapter focuses on how to improve the rate at which new users become active users of a product or service. The authors emphasize that even after a product has achieved \"must-have\" status, it's crucial to ensure that new users quickly experience its core value. This process is called **activation**, and it's not a one-time event but a series of steps that a new user takes to engage with the product.\n\nThe authors outline three essential steps to identify high-impact activation experiments:\n\n* **Mapping the route to the \"aha moment\"**: This involves identifying all of the steps that new users must take in order to experience the core value of a product. For example, a grocery app's \"aha moment\" is when users realize they can quickly and easily order groceries on the fly. The steps to get there might include downloading the app, finding items, adding them to a cart, creating an account, and making a purchase.\n* **Creating a funnel report**: This report tracks the conversion rates at each step of the customer journey to the aha moment. It also tracks the channels through which users arrive at the product. For instance, a report for Uber would track how many people download the app, open it, create an account, book a ride, and rate their driver. This will highlight the specific steps where users are dropping off, and this information can guide experimentation.\n* **Conducting user surveys and interviews**: This involves gathering qualitative data from users who have either progressed successfully through each step, those who became inactive after some steps, or those who bounced early. This can help understand the reasons behind drop-offs.\n\nThe chapter provides several best practices for increasing activation, such as:\n\n* **Optimizing the new user experience (NUX)**, which should:\n  * Communicate relevance.\n  * Show the value of the product.\n  * Provide a clear call to action.\n* **Simplifying the onboarding process**. The authors discuss the concept of \"learn flow,\" where users are guided through a series of steps that show them the value of a product and help them customize it to their needs.\n* **Using questionnaires to gather user information**, but not asking too many questions and using multiple choice answers.\n* **Using gamification**, which includes offering rewards for taking specific actions. The rewards can range from subtle to overt, and the key is to focus on meaningful rewards, creating surprise and delight, and providing instant gratification. Examples of gamification include progress meters, points, and loyalty programs.\n\nThe chapter also discusses the use of **triggers**, which are prompts that urge users to re-engage with a product. The authors emphasize that the rationale for triggers should be to alert users to an opportunity of clear value to them. They also suggest using the six principles of persuasion outlined by Robert Cialdini, which include reciprocity, commitment and consistency, social proof, authority, liking, and scarcity, when crafting triggers.  The authors distinguish between external triggers, which are prompts from the company, and internal triggers, which are habits that users develop.\n\n# Chapter 7: Retention: How to Keep Customers Coming Back\n\nThis chapter focuses on customer retention, emphasizing its critical role in achieving profitability for businesses. The authors argue that **high retention rates are crucial because acquiring new customers is expensive**. They cite research indicating that a 5% increase in customer retention can lead to a 25% to 95% increase in profits. Additionally, retaining customers enhances the effectiveness of word-of-mouth and viral marketing efforts, as longer-term users have more opportunities to share and recommend the product or service.\n\nThe chapter addresses how to identify and prevent customer churn, or defection. The authors suggest that **growth hacking is an ideal method for managing customer retention**, using the example of a grocery app that experienced a slide in usage after the first month.  They argue that before trying to re-engage users, a company must assess the core drivers of retention. Fundamentally, **retention depends on delivering a high-quality product or service that meets customer needs** and is considered must-have. A stable retention curve is a strong indicator of achieving product/market fit, in contrast to a curve showing increasing customer abandonment.\n\nThe authors then discuss tactics for both initial and long-term customer retention. For initial retention, strategies are similar to those used for improving activation, such as refining the new user experience. Triggers like mobile notifications and emails can also help reinforce the product's value, though companies should avoid over-reliance on these tactics.\n\nA key concept is **habit formation**, where products become integrated into users' routines. The chapter uses Amazon's Prime program as an example of a powerful habit-creating mechanism because it provides both the rewards of free shipping and the instant gratification of two-day delivery. This encourages frequent purchases, reinforcing the value of the Prime subscription. The authors state that **enhancing the perceived value of rewards generally leads to greater retention**. This can be achieved by offering a variety of rewards and encouraging action to receive them, which builds habit and perceived value. The authors suggest using cohort analysis to identify avid users, what features they use the most, and what rewards result in the highest retention rate.\n\nThree strategies are highlighted for boosting habit formation and retention:\n\n* **Brand Ambassador Programs**: These programs combine social and tangible rewards, conferring status and recognition.  Yelp's Elite program is given as an example where the program leads to high levels of user contributions. Other examples include the American Express Centurion card which offers social status with a range of perks, as well as theSkimm, which encourages referrals for public recognition and perks.\n\n* **Personalization and Customization**: This strategy includes tailoring experiences, content, and offers based on individual preferences and behaviors.  The authors offer the example of Pinterest's \"Copytune\" program which uses machine learning to rapidly test notification variants across languages to optimize their effectiveness.\n\n* **Ongoing Onboarding**: As new features are added, companies should continue to educate customers to help them get the most value from the product, and lead them on a \"continuous journey of discovery\". The concept of \"ramp up\" where users master new features incrementally over time is introduced.\n\nFor long-term retention, the authors recommend a two-pronged approach:\n\n1. **Optimizing current features and rewards**: It's crucial to ensure the product continues to provide value and delight through refinement and enhancements.\n2. **Introducing new features**: Companies should be judicious when adding new features, avoiding \"feature bloat\" which can overcomplicate the product and obscure its core value.\n\n# Chapter 8: Monetization: How to Make Money from Your Customers\n\nThe ultimate goal of acquiring, activating, and retaining customers is to generate revenue, and ideally, to increase the lifetime value (LTV) of customers over time. Many growth teams focus on acquisition and activation but miss the potential for growth through effective monetization.\n\n### Mapping the Monetization Funnel\n\n* The first step in optimizing earnings is to map the customer journey from acquisition to retention, highlighting all opportunities for earning revenue and identifying any barriers to revenue generation such as friction in the payment process.\n* Analysis of the customer journey should identify high-value pages and features, which can be targets for increased revenue, as well as pinch points with poor conversion rates that need to be addressed.\n* Common pinch points to evaluate include landing pages, pricing pages, shopping carts, payment processes and checkout flows.\n* A detailed analysis of the monetization funnel is crucial and can reveal weak spots specific to a product. For instance, a retailer might find low sales on certain product pages, while a content provider may discover video ads underperforming in a particular ad space.\n* Many analytics packages offer tools for displaying purchase funnels, while advertising services provide software for ad response analysis.\n* However, a complete mapping of a company's monetization funnel often requires additional work by a data analyst.\n\n### Analyzing Customer Cohorts\n\n* Customer data should be divided into cohorts to assess revenue generation.\n* The first cohorts to identify are **higher-profit versus lower-profit customers**. For a subscription service, this may be based on the subscription level; for an e-commerce company, it could be based on spending per period.\n* For ad-revenue-based companies, the analysis is more complex. The average revenue per user (ARPU) should be tracked, as well as user engagement with ads.\n* Segmentation of user groups should be based on factors like time spent on the site or in the app, and the number of pages or screens viewed per session.\n\n### Customer Segmentation and Personas\n\n* Identifying general groupings of customers who share similar characteristics is essential.\n* These groupings may share factors such as location, experience, spending habits, or needs.\n* The goal of these groupings is to generate ideas for satisfying specific customer wants and needs.\n* Many marketers create **personas**, fictional dossiers of a representative customer from each group.\n* For example, a company could identify customer personas as new agents, experienced agents, brokers, and executives, then customize experiences for each persona.\n\n### Expanding Product Offerings\n\n* To increase purchase volume, offering additional items or features to customers is important.\n* The key is to offer features and products that customers value and are willing to pay for rather than features that the company conjectures they want.\n* It is important to remember the dangers of \"feature creep\" which can make a product overly complicated.\n* Companies should focus on making thoughtful additions to their products that enhance the user experience and encourage spending.\n\n### Customizing Offers With Data\n\n* Personalization, especially through customized recommendations, is effective for monetization.\n* Customized recommendations are often delivered on a website or in an app, as well as through email and mobile push messages.\n* **Amazon's \"recommendation engine\"** is an example of a powerful system that customizes item recommendations based on a customer’s search and buying habits, as well as habits of other similar shoppers.\n* By using customer data to determine their specific needs, businesses can recommend products to customers that they are most likely to purchase.\n* For example, a liquor store might suggest mixers to customers who purchase a certain type of liquor, based on data that indicates those customers also tend to purchase mixers.\n\n### Balancing Customization with Privacy\n\n* It is important to be sensitive about how customization is implemented, so as not to be perceived as too intrusive.\n* A case in point is the retailer Target, which sent coupons for baby items to a teen who was trying to hide her pregnancy from her family, leading to a backlash.\n* Customization should be done with respect for customer privacy to avoid negative reactions.\n\n### Pricing Strategies\n\n* Businesses selling physical goods have a relatively straightforward path for pricing, but growth teams can experiment by considering customer behavior and LTV.\n* **\"Charm prices,\"** which end with 9 or 99, can boost sales by an average of 24 percent compared to nearby prices.\n* It's also important to present prices clearly, particularly for tiered plans.\n* Multiple pricing options should be easily compared so customers can see the relative value of the different offerings.\n\n### Price Sensitivity\n\n* Lowering prices can lead to higher sales volume, but not necessarily.\n* Sometimes lowering the price can fail to provide the hoped-for boost in sales, or even hurt sales.\n* Experimenting with price reductions before implementing them across the customer base is important.\n* It is important to be aware of the psychological impact of pricing on customers and adjust strategies accordingly.\n\n### Social Proof\n\n* Social proof, such as reviews and testimonials, can influence customers' purchasing decisions.\n* However, social proof must be implemented correctly to be effective.\n* Unbelievable or non-specific testimonials should be avoided as they can raise doubts about authenticity.\n* **CRAVENS** is an acronym for the seven core factors of effective reviews and testimonials: Credible, Relevant, Attractive, Visual, Enumerated, Nearby purchase points, and Specific.\n* It is important to display social proof in a way that is relevant and helpful to customers.\n\nGrowth teams should use data analysis to map the monetization funnel, identify opportunities and barriers, segment customers into cohorts, understand customer needs, and experiment with pricing strategies, all while respecting privacy.\n\n# Chapter 9: A Virtuous Growth Cycle\n\nThis chapter emphasizes that driving growth is a continuous process, not a one-time task. The most successful companies sustain their growth by constantly pushing for more, leveraging their achievements, and seizing new opportunities. The authors caution against complacency, stating that in today's competitive market, stagnation leads to decline. This chapter serves to highlight the importance of maintaining the growth hacking mindset across all the growth stages, from acquisition to monetization, and the need to avoid common pitfalls that lead to growth stalls.\n\nThe authors use Facebook as an example of a company that has sustained its growth over a decade due to its growth teams' relentless efforts. Facebook’s growth team, started with just five people, is now responsible for the seemingly unstoppable growth of the largest social network of all time. This highlights that continuous growth is achievable with a well-implemented growth strategy.\n\n**Avoiding Growth Stalls**:\n\n* The chapter addresses the common issue of growth stalls, which can be detrimental to even leading brands.\n* Growth stalls can occur when companies become complacent, failing to adapt to the changing market conditions, and rely on the initial success of their products. This can lead to a decline in user engagement and revenue, ultimately jeopardizing the business.\n* **The authors stress that a key aspect of avoiding a growth stall is continuous experimentation and optimization across all aspects of the customer journey**.\n\n**Key Actions to Sustain Growth**: The chapter outlines several steps that companies can take to maintain a virtuous growth cycle:\n\n* **Revisit the User Experience**: The authors emphasize the importance of continuously reviewing and optimizing the user experience. This includes conducting ongoing user testing, addressing any issues that might be hindering user engagement, and making sure the user experience is intuitive and enjoyable.\n* **Analyze Data Gaps**: **Growth teams should identify any gaps in their data collection and analysis**. This includes identifying any missed opportunities for gathering more information about product use and customer behavior, including user's preferred features, and where users may be experiencing pain points. If necessary, hiring a data analyst to work full-time can improve the team's analysis capability.\n* **Explore New Channels**: While focusing on one or two channels for customer acquisition is effective at the start, teams should experiment with adding new channels. This will help companies to reach new customer segments and reduce the risk of growth stalls. The authors suggest that a company reliant solely on paid acquisition should develop organic channels such as SEO, content marketing, or social media.\n* **Don't Neglect Big Bets**: The authors discuss the need to continually optimize existing processes while also looking for \"moonshot\" opportunities. These \"moonshot\" bets represent high-risk, high-reward ideas that can lead to significant breakthroughs. One example is Uber’s experimentation with self-driving cars. While still in limited testing at the time of writing, this type of bold experiment can yield significant growth opportunities.\n* **Maintain a Growth Mindset**: The authors stress that growth hacking is more than a business strategy; it is a philosophy and a way of thinking that should be adopted by every team member and the company as a whole. The authors hope the book has inspired the reader to adopt this way of thinking.\n\n**The Virtuous Cycle**:\n\n* The chapter concludes by reiterating the importance of creating a virtuous cycle of growth where initial success leads to further growth and innovation. This cycle involves constantly experimenting, optimizing, and learning from past results.\n* **The key to this virtuous cycle is that growth teams should never rest on their laurels and need to keep pushing for further growth**.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
