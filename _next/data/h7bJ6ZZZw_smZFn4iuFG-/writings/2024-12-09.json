{"pageProps":{"content":"# Notes - The Mars Family - M&M Mars Candy Makers\n*December 8, 2024*\n# Chapter 1: Candy King\n\n### The Beginning of Mars Inc.\n\nMars Inc., famous for candies such as M\\&M’s®, Snickers®, Milky Way®, and 3 Musketeers®, is one of the world's largest food manufacturers. The company's history started over 125 years ago with the birth of Frank Mars.\n\n### Frank Mars' Early Life\n\nFranklin C. Mars was born on September 24, 1882, in Hancock, Minnesota. He grew up in Saint Paul, Minnesota, where his father worked as a gristmill operator. While his family did not have much money, his father brought home plenty of flour. Frank’s mother, Alva, used the flour to bake bread, cookies, pies, and cakes.\n\n### Frank Mars Learns To Make Candy\n\nAt a young age, Frank contracted polio and recovered but was left unable to stand or walk without a cane. Frank’s mother taught him to make candy to keep him busy. He grew up making caramels, fudge, and other sweet treats. By high school, Frank was already creating his own candy recipes. After graduating from Breck School in Wilder, Minnesota, in 1901, Frank was ready to start his career.\n\n# Chapter 2: Trial and Error\n\n### Frank's Early Career and Family Life\n\nAfter graduating, Frank continued working with candy. By 1902, he was managing a candy company near Minneapolis, Minnesota, selling Taylor’s Molasses Chips to stores in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area.  He married Ethel G. Kissack, a schoolteacher, in December 1902. Their son, Forrest Edward, was born in Wadena, Minnesota on March 21, 1904.\n\n### Business Challenges and Setbacks\n\nFrank traveled extensively to sell candy, often being away for weeks. The long travel times led to his candies spoiling before he could sell them, ultimately causing the company to fail.\n\n### Family Separation and New Beginnings\n\nDue to their financial struggles, Ethel divorced Frank in 1910 and sent Forrest to live with her parents in Canada because she couldn’t care for him alone. Frank remarried another woman named Ethel, and they had a daughter, Patricia. The new family relocated to Washington State, where Frank persisted in his pursuit of a successful candy business. After several unsuccessful attempts, Frank returned to Minnesota in 1920.\n\n### The Mar-O-Bar Company and Early Success\n\nIn Minneapolis, Frank founded the Mar-O-Bar Company, named after one of his candy creations. Although customers enjoyed his Mar-O-Bars, they favored his butter cream candies, leading to high sales and the establishment of a thriving business by 1923.\n\n# Chapter 3: Growing Up\n\n### Forrest's Childhood in Canada\n\nForrest spent his childhood with his grandparents in North Brattleford, Saskatchewan, Canada after being sent there by his mother. He had no contact with his father during this time. Although Ethel, Forrest's mother, wrote letters to Forrest, he never saw his father.\n\n### Forrest's Education\n\nForrest excelled academically, particularly in mathematics, and enjoyed reading and learning trivia. He also enjoyed games like chess, cribbage, and poker. Walking approximately three miles each day, Forrest attended Lethbridge Central School in Alberta, Canada. In 1922, he graduated and received a scholarship to study mining at the University of California at Berkeley.\n\n### Forrest's Business Acumen\n\nWhile attending Berkeley, Forrest worked in the university kitchen. He discovered a business opportunity by purchasing meat and selling it to the kitchen chefs. This venture proved so successful that he was making around $100 each week and decided to stop his studies to concentrate on his business endeavors.\n\n# Chapter 4: Father and Son\n\n### Forrest's Arrest and Reunion with Frank\n\nIn the summer of 1923, Forrest was working as a traveling salesman in Chicago, Illinois. In an attempt to drum up business, he put advertisements on all of the significant buildings along State Street. This action led to his arrest, an event that was subsequently covered by newspapers.\n\nWhen Frank learned about his son's predicament, he went to the jail to post Forrest's bail. This marked the first time Forrest had seen his father since he was six years old. After Forrest was released, they went to a soda fountain together.\n\n### A New Candy Bar Idea\n\nRather than dwelling on the past, Frank and Forrest chose to discuss business matters. Forrest proposed that Frank create a candy bar inspired by the flavor of the chocolate malts they were enjoying.  Frank found this to be an excellent idea. Upon his return to Minnesota, he invented a new candy bar called the **Milky Way**.\n\n### The Success of the Milky Way\n\nThe Milky Way bar was composed of malt-flavored nougat, topped with a layer of caramel, and then completely enrobed in a chocolate coating. In 1924, Frank began selling Milky Way bars for five cents each. The public loved this substantial and fluffy chocolate treat, and by the end of the year, sales of Milky Way bars had reached almost $800,000.\n\n### Forrest's Continued Education and Business Acumen\n\nAfter his time in Chicago, Forrest went back to California. In 1925, he transferred to the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, where he pursued studies in industrial engineering.\n\nSimultaneously, Forrest immersed himself in books about successful companies. He was a serious and driven individual with an innate understanding of business. Recognizing the potential for cost savings, Forrest advised Frank to relocate his business to Chicago. Frank heeded his son's suggestion, and in 1927, construction began on a new factory in Chicago.\n\n# Chapter 5: Life in Europe\n\n### Forrest Sr. Learns From the Best\n\nAfter Frank Mars's death, Forrest Sr. focuses on building Mars Ltd. in Europe. To gain expertise in chocolate making, he works in the factories of renowned Swiss chocolatiers Jean Tobler and Henri Nestlé in 1933. Forrest Sr.'s true intentions as a knowledge-seeker are concealed, allowing him to learn their trade secrets.\n\n### Success with Mars Bars\n\nForrest Sr. establishes his factory in Slough, England, where he and his family live in a modest apartment behind the factory, enduring hardships with limited resources and comfort. Despite the challenges, he creates a sweeter version of the Milky Way bar, naming it the Mars bar, which quickly becomes popular in England.\n\n### Expanding into Pet Food\n\nIn 1934, Forrest Sr. expands his business beyond candy by acquiring a British pet food company called Chappel Bros Ltd., also known as Chappie's. This acquisition marks the beginning of the Mars company's venture into the pet food market. Within five years, he achieves a fivefold increase in pet food sales.\n\n# Chapter 6: Making Money\n\n### Relocating and Rebranding\n\nIn addition to changing locations from Minnesota to Chicago, Frank changed the name of his company to Mars Inc.  After graduating from Yale in 1928, Forrest began working for the company.\n\n### Expanding the Mars Product Line\n\nDuring the 1930s, Frank invented new candy bars. The Snickers bar, which combines peanuts, nougat, caramel, and chocolate, was introduced in 1930. In 1932, Frank invented the 3 Musketeers bar.  Initially, this chocolate-covered bar had three separate pieces of nougat: vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry.   When strawberry prices increased, Frank switched to one large piece of chocolate nougat.\n\n### Achieving Success and Aiming Higher\n\nBy 1932, Mars Inc. was selling over $25 million worth of chocolate annually. Only the Hershey Chocolate Company was larger in the United States. While Frank was content with this accomplishment, Forrest aspired for greater things, expressing a desire to “conquer the whole world.”  By 1929, Mars was already producing 20 million candy bars a year.\n\n### Forrest's Family\n\nIn the early stages of his career, Forrest met Audrey Meyer. They married in 1930 and soon started a family. Their son, Forrest Edward Jr., was born on August 13, 1931. John Franklin was born on October 1, 1935, and their daughter, Jacqueline Anne, was born on October 10, 1939.  Milky Way bars made a strong impression on customers when they were first sold due to their large size.\n\n# Chapter 7: M\\&M’s Magic\n\n### The Inspiration for M\\&M's\n\nDuring his travels in Europe, Forrest Sr. visited Spain, where he observed soldiers consuming small, sugar-coated chocolate candies. He was intrigued by the sugar coating's ability to prevent the chocolate from melting.\n\n### Collaboration with Hershey Chocolate Company\n\nUpon returning to the United States with his family in 1939, at the start of World War II, Forrest Sr. sought to bring his idea of candy-coated chocolates to life.  He met with William Murrie, the president of the Hershey Chocolate Company, in Hershey, Pennsylvania. During their meeting, Forrest Sr. showed Murrie the candy-coated chocolates, explaining that the candies remained intact despite being carried in his pocket throughout his long train journey.\n\n### The Birth of M\\&M’s\n\nForrest Sr. proposed a partnership with Murrie's son, Bruce, to establish a new candy business. He suggested that Hershey supply the chocolate and named the candy M\\&M's, with one \"M\" representing Mars and the other \"M\" representing Murrie.  Both William and Bruce Murrie agreed to the plan. In 1940, M\\&M Ltd. commenced operations in Newark, New Jersey, supplying M\\&M's to U.S. troops. The candy's resistance to melting made it popular among soldiers.\n\n### Post-War Success and Iconic Slogan\n\nFollowing the war, M\\&M's gained widespread popularity in the United States.  The famous slogan, \"melts in your mouth, not in your hands,\" was introduced in 1954.   By 1956, M\\&M's had become the most popular candy in America.\n\n### M\\&M's in Space\n\nThe enduring popularity of M\\&M's is evident in its inclusion on Air Force One, the U.S. president's airplane.  Furthermore, in 1982, M\\&M's became the first candy consumed in space and has been part of space shuttle missions ever since.\n\n# Chapter 8: M\\&M’s Magic\n\n### Inspiration from Spanish Soldiers\n\nWhile traveling in Europe, Forrest Sr. observes Spanish soldiers eating small pieces of chocolate with a sugar coating that prevents melting. Intrigued by this concept, he recognizes its potential.\n\n### Partnership with Hershey\n\nUpon his return to the United States in 1939 at the onset of World War II, Forrest Sr. seeks to bring his idea of candy-coated chocolates to fruition. He approaches William Murrie, president of the Hershey Chocolate Company, in Hershey, Pennsylvania, sharing his vision and showcasing the durability of the candy by demonstrating how they remained intact in his pocket throughout his train journey.\n\n### The Birth of M\\&M's\n\nForrest Sr. proposes a partnership with Murrie's son, Bruce, suggesting Hershey supply the chocolate for their new venture. They agree to name the candy M\\&M's, with one \"M\" representing Mars and the other representing Murrie. In 1940, M\\&M Ltd. commences operations in Newark, New Jersey, and quickly becomes a supplier of M\\&M's to U.S. troops, who appreciate the candy's resistance to melting.\n\n### Post-War Success\n\nAfter World War II, M\\&M's popularity extends to the civilian population in the United States. In 1954, the iconic slogan \"melts in your mouth, not in your hands\" is introduced, further solidifying its appeal. By 1956, M\\&M's rises to become the most popular candy in America. The enduring popularity of M\\&M's is evident in its inclusion among the provisions on Air Force One, the U.S. president's airplane.\n\n# Chapter 9: Family Ties\n\n### Forrest Sr. Gains Full Ownership of Mars Inc.\n\nForrest Sr. desired to acquire his father's portion of the Mars business.  Frank's wife initially refused to sell to Forrest Sr., but he inherited half of her shares upon her death in 1945.  In December 1964, Forrest Sr. purchased the remaining shares of his father's company, becoming the sole owner of Mars Inc.  Subsequently, he integrated all his food businesses into Mars Inc.\n\n### A Modest Childhood for the Mars Children\n\nAlthough growing up with a candy industry leader as their father might seem enjoyable, Forrest Jr., John, and Jacqueline had ordinary childhoods. Despite their family's wealth, they lived without any hired help.\n\n### Instilling a Strong Work Ethic\n\nTo prevent his children from becoming spoiled, Forrest Sr. instilled a strong work ethic in them. If they wanted something, they had to earn it. Their parents didn't provide them with fancy clothes, expensive cars, allowances, or even free candy.\n\n### Training the Next Generation\n\nForrest Jr. graduated from Yale University in 1953, while John also attended Yale before serving in the U.S. Army from 1956 to 1958.  After their education, Forrest Sr. involved his children in the business, providing them with training. He maintained high standards and held them accountable for their performance, treating them like any other employee, even though they were family.\n\n### High Standards and Employee Empowerment\n\nForrest Sr. demanded perfection from his family and employees, expecting the highest quality from every product. If it didn't meet his standards, he would discard it and make the workers start over. However, Mars employees received good compensation and were encouraged to share their ideas with Forrest Sr.\n\n### Retirement and New Ventures\n\nIn 1969, Forrest Sr. retired from Mars Inc., passing the reins to Forrest Jr. and John, with Jacqueline later assuming a leadership role.  Even after retirement, Forrest Sr. remained active. In 1980, he founded Ethel M Chocolates in Henderson, Nevada, named after his mother.  Ethel M Chocolates was later incorporated into Mars Inc. in 2003.\n\n# Chapter 10: Quiet Years\n\n### Forrest Sr. Retires and Starts a New Company\n\nIn 1969, Forrest Sr. retired from Mars Inc., handing over the reins to his sons Forrest Jr. and John. Jacqueline, their sister, later joined them as a company leader.  Forrest Sr.'s retirement wasn’t a complete departure from the world of confectionery. In 1980, he established a new candy company, Ethel M Chocolates, in Henderson, Nevada, named in honor of his mother. In 2003, Ethel M Chocolates was integrated into Mars Inc.\n\n### A Private Life\n\nDespite his immense wealth, Forrest Sr. maintained a remarkably private life after retirement, never discussing the company and leaving its management to his children. This preference for privacy extended to Forrest Jr., John, and Jacqueline, who also guarded their personal lives closely.\n\n### Forrest Sr.'s Legacy\n\nForrest Sr. passed away in Miami, Florida, on July 1, 1999, at the age of 95. At the time of his death, his net worth exceeded $4 billion, placing him among the wealthiest individuals in the United States.\n\n# Chapter 11: Mars Today\n\n### Continued Success and New Products\n\nAfter Forrest Sr.'s retirement, Mars Inc. continued to thrive under the leadership of his children.  The company expanded its product line, introducing **Skittles** candies in 1979.  In 1986, they launched **Kudos**, a popular granola and chocolate bar, and also created **Combos**, a filled pretzel snack.\n\n### Acquiring Dove and Expanding into Ice Cream\n\nIn 1986, Mars acquired **Dove International**.  In 1991, they used the rich Dove chocolate to create the popular **Dove Promises** chocolates.  Expanding into the ice cream market, Mars began manufacturing ice cream versions of **3 Musketeers, Snickers, and Milky Way** bars in 1989.\n\n### A Major Acquisition and Global Reach\n\nIn 2008, the Mars company grew even larger with the acquisition of the **William Wrigley Jr. Company**.  Wrigley's had a history of over 100 years in producing chewing gum and other candy products.  This acquisition created an even more powerful and successful company.  Today, the Mars family sells its products in over 180 countries.\n\n### Commitment to Quality and Global Impact\n\nMars Inc. utilizes the latest technology in its clean and well-managed factories.  The company's dedication to quality and excellence has resulted in products that are enjoyed by both people and animals worldwide.  Mars produces **seven of the world's top 20 chocolate snacks**.\n\n### Fun Facts About M\\&M's\n\nM\\&M's, a popular candy in the United States, has achieved global recognition as the world's most popular candy.
