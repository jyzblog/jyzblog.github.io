{"pageProps":{"content":"# Notes - Henry Ellenbogen and the Art of Compounding\n*December 18, 2025*\n\nHenry Ellenbogen, a renowned investor who transformed the T. Rowe Price New Horizons fund from $8 billion to $40 billion over nine years. His approach centers on identifying \"compounders\"—rare companies capable of sustained, long-term growth—and navigating the \"painful transitions\" where these companies either succeed or fail,.\n\n\n## 1. The Influence of Legacy and Early Career\nEllenbogen’s background is rooted in a legacy of quiet service and high achievement. \n*   **The Grandfather’s Secret:** After his grandfather (the elder Henry Ellenbogen, a Congressman and Judge) died, the family discovered he had secretly saved **thousands of lives** from the Holocaust by typing sponsorship letters and navigating immigration law,,.\n*   **\"The Boy Wonder\":** At age 19, Ellenbogen became the youngest administrative assistant (Chief of Staff) in the history of the **U.S.  Representatives** for Congressman Peter Deutsch.\n*   **Formative Training:** During a summer at **Goldman Sachs’ risk arbitrage group**, he realized he did not want to be an \"insurance adjuster\" calculating price corrections; instead, he wanted to support people building enduring businesses,.\n\n## 2. The Science of the \"Compounder\"\nEllenbogen’s philosophy was refined through his study of market history and his tenure at T. Rowe Price.\n*   **The Walmart Lesson:** By studying 50 years of New Horizons archives, Ellenbogen discovered that **only 20 stocks** had driven the fund’s success. He realized that selling a company like **Walmart** prematurely was a catastrophic mistake that no other good decision could offset.\n*   **The 1% Rule:** Data revealed that in any 10-year period, only about **40 out of 4,000 public stocks (1%)** compound wealth at **20% annually**. \n*   **Characteristics of Compounders:** These businesses show **increasing returns on invested capital**, meaning they get better and face lepetition as they gain scale. Examples include **Vail Resorts**, where acquisitions created a subscription-based network that shifted risk from the company to the customer.\n\n## 3. The \"Act 1 to Act 2\" Framework\nA central tenet of Ellenbogen’s method is separating companies that are *dying* from those being *remade*. \n*   **Act 1:** The stage where a company proves product-market fit and unit economics.\n*   **Act 2:** The \"leap\" to a new product or market that makes the business fundamentally larger. \n*   **The Valley of Death:** Transitions between acts are **intensely volatile**; a typical compounder might fall **62%** during its journey. \n    *   ***Example: Netflix:*** In 2011, Netflix's transition from DVD-by-mail to streaming caused 800,000 cancellations and a **75% stock drop**,. Ellenbogen recognized it as a transition, not a failure, and led a **$400 million private investment** to save the company.\n    *   ***Example: Amazon:*** Contrary to the myth that Jeff Bezos ignored profit, Ellenbogen observed that Bezos ran the retail business with **obsessive operational discipline**, establishing a cash stream *before* investing in new initiatives like AWS,.\n\n## 4. Bridging Public and Private Markets\nEllenbogen pioneered the practice of mutual funds investing in late-stage startups, arguing that companies were staying private longer and capturing more growth before their IPO,.\n*   **The \"Rogue Effort\":** Starting with companies like **Twitter** and **Workday**, Ellenbogen systematically deployed mutual fund capital into private rounds,.\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** His team covers both public and private companies because younger companies often reveal **disruptive threats** to existing winners (e.g., studying the disruption in web hosting led him to **Wix and Shopify**).\n*   **The Network Effect:** Ellenbogen uses a \"self-reinforcing\" network to help startups scale by placing experienced public-company CEOs (like **Jeff Boyd of Priceline**) onto the boards of private companies (like **Clear** and **Redfin**),.\n\n## 5. \"The Last Human Edge\": Man vs. Machine\nIn the age of algorithmic trading and AI (the \"robots\"), Ellenbogen argues that humans maintain a distinct advantage in specific areas.\n*   **Trust and Empathy:** Machines cannot build the trust required to call a CEO on a Saturday morning to discuss bankruptcy or structure a complex rescue deal.\n*   **Interpreting Signals:** Robots struggle to understand why a CEO selling shares at a loss might be a **positive signal** rather than a negative one.\n*   **The Amygdala:** Understanding the temperament of an entrepreneur who is solving a problem requires human judgment and an understanding of **probabilities and people**,,.\n\n## 6. Durable Capital Partners and Modern Crisis Management\nIn 2019, Ellenbogen founded **Durable Capital Partners** to pursue compounding without the structural limitations of mutual funds,.\n*   **Investing in Chaos:** During the COVID-19 crash, he invested **$110 million in Redfin** and **$150 million in FirstService**, providing capitalhen others were paralyzed by uncertainty,.\n*   **Navigating the High-Interest Era:** In 2022, as \"free money\" ended, Ellenbogen guided his portfolio companies, such as **Duolingo** and **Affirm**, to pivot from pure growth to **extreme financial rigor and profitability**,.\n*   **The AI Platform Shift:** Ellenbogen views **AI** as the fourth major platform shift of his career (following web, mobile, and cloud) and is currently identifying which emerging companies will dominate this new era.","headings":[{"level":2,"text":"1.
