<p><em>July 10, 2025</em></p>
<h3>1. Chuck Akre, Akre Capital Management</h3>
<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Chuck Akre is a veteran value investor renowned for his &quot;three-legged stool&quot; investment philosophy. This framework prioritizes businesses with exceptional management, high returns on capital, and significant reinvestment opportunities. He founded Akre Capital Management in 1989 and is known for his long-term, concentrated investment approach, often holding companies for many years.</p>
<p><strong>Investment Philosophy:</strong> Akre&#x27;s strategy can be described as investing in &quot;compounding machines.&quot; He focuses on identifying high-quality businesses with durable competitive advantages, often referred to as &quot;economic moats.&quot; Unlike traditional value investors who may focus on statistically cheap stocks, Akre is willing to pay a fair price for an exceptional business with strong growth potential. His firm is known for its low turnover, reflecting a patient, long-term perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Trades (as of Q1 2025):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Holdings Value:</strong> Akre Capital Management&#x27;s 13F portfolio value was approximately $10.4 billion.</li>
<li><strong>New Positions:</strong> No new positions were initiated in the most recent quarter.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Stakes:</strong> The firm added to its positions in Brookfield Corp. (BN), Airbnb (ABNB), and CCC Intelligent Solutions (CCCS).</li>
<li><strong>Decreased Stakes:</strong> Akre trimmed positions in several long-term winners, including Mastercard (MA), O&#x27;Reilly Automotive (ORLY), Moody&#x27;s (MCO), and Visa (V). This appears to be a case of harvesting gains in highly appreciated holdings.</li>
<li><strong>Significant Holdings:</strong> The top five holdings in the portfolio were Mastercard, O&#x27;Reilly Automotive, Moody&#x27;s, Visa, and KKR, accounting for roughly 61% of the portfolio&#x27;s value.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recent Talks and Insights:</strong> In recent discussions, Akre has continued to emphasize the importance of focusing on business fundamentals rather than short-term market fluctuations. He advises investors to avoid getting caught up in market trends and instead concentrate on identifying exceptional companies trading at reasonable prices. His core message remains consistent: invest in high-quality businesses with enduring competitive advantages and let the power of compounding work over the long term.</p>
<h3>2. Dennis Hong, ShawSpring Partners</h3>
<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Dennis Hong is the founder and portfolio manager of ShawSpring Partners. A Yale University graduate, he launched the firm in 2014 after working at other prominent investment firms. ShawSpring pursues a long-term, highly concentrated investment approach, typically holding a portfolio of 5-10 businesses.</p>
<p><strong>Investment Philosophy:</strong> Hong&#x27;s investment strategy focuses on high-growth businesses with durable competitive advantages and strong alignment between management and shareholders. He takes a long-term perspective and is willing to hold investments for many years to allow for compounding. His firm primarily invests in the technology, internet, and consumer sectors globally.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Activity:</strong> Specific recent trades for ShawSpring Partners are not as readily available in public filings due to the nature of their reporting. However, Hong has been active in sharing his investment philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Talks and Insights:</strong> In recent interviews, Hong has spoken about the importance of building a &quot;world-class partnership&quot; based on seeking exceptional returns and a commitment to long-term compounding. He emphasizes the significance of having a strong relationship with the management of the companies he invests in. For young investors, he recommends gaining exposure to as many companies as possible to build pattern recognition and to focus on understanding the underlying business dynamics.</p>
<h3>3. Pat Dorsey, Dorsey Asset Management</h3>
<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Pat Dorsey is a renowned expert on &quot;economic moats,&quot; a concept he helped popularize during his time as the Director of Equity Research at Morningstar. He is the founder of Dorsey Asset Management, where he employs a moat-focused, long-term investment strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Investment Philosophy:</strong> Dorsey&#x27;s investment approach is a blend of growth and value investing, with a strong emphasis on identifying companies with durable competitive advantages. He seeks to buy these &quot;moated&quot; businesses at fair prices and hold them for the long term. The four primary sources of economic moats he identifies are intangible assets, high switching costs, network effects, and cost advantages.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Trades:</strong> Detailed quarterly trades for Dorsey Asset Management are not always publicly available. However, his largest reported holdings include Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet (GOOG).</p>
<p><strong>Recent Talks and Insights:</strong> In recent talks and writings, Dorsey continues to elaborate on the concept of economic moats. He cautions investors against mistaking strong brands or market share for a true moat. A key indicator of a moat, he suggests, is a company&#x27;s ability to consistently raise prices without losing customers. He stresses that while capitalism is effective at eroding high returns on capital, companies with genuine moats can defy this trend for extended periods.</p>
<h3>4. Josh Tarasoff, Greenlea Lane Capital</h3>
<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Josh Tarasoff is the founder and General Partner of Greenlea Lane Capital, a private investment partnership he established in 2006. He is known for his independent and highly concentrated investment approach, running a &quot;self-driving&quot; portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>Investment Philosophy:</strong> Tarasoff&#x27;s strategy is characterized by extreme selectivity and a long-term, permanent holding period. He focuses on businesses with strong fundamentals, sustainable advantages, and honest management. A key differentiator in his approach is his willingness to invest in companies driving predictable change, such as the shift to online retail or cloud computing, which he believes can be as certain as the consistency sought by traditional value investors. He is comfortable with companies that may not appear statistically cheap but have the potential for significant long-term value creation.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Activity:</strong> Specific recent trades for Greenlea Lane Capital are not publicly disclosed.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Talks and Insights:</strong> In recent interviews and essays, Tarasoff has discussed his concept of a &quot;self-driving portfolio,&quot; which aims for an infinite time horizon. He believes that this long-term perspective improves decision-making. He also emphasizes the importance of a &quot;mission-driven culture&quot; as a key indicator of a quality company. Tarasoff&#x27;s approach is a departure from the typical investment firm model; he operates with a lean team and without a formal office, allowing him to focus on his core investment activity.</p>
<h3>5. Glenn Welling, Engaged Capital</h3>

Welling has a background in private equity and has been involved in numerous activist campaigns aimed at unlocking shareholder value.</p>
<p><strong>Investment Philosophy:</strong> Engaged Capital takes an activist approach, meaning they take significant stakes in companies and then work with management and the board to implement changes they believe will improve the company&#x27;s performance and stock price. Their focus is on undervalued companies where they see a path to operational or strategic improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Activity:</strong> Due to the nature of activist investing, Engaged Capital&#x27;s new positions and campaigns are often announced publicly. It is recommended to follow financial news outlets for the latest on their activities.</p>

He has also spoken about the global potential of value investing, particularly in modernizing economies.</p>
<h3>7. Guy Spier, Aquamarine Capital</h3>
<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Guy Spier is a Zurich-based investor and the author of the popular book, &quot;The Education of a Value Investor.&quot; He is known for his thoughtful and ethical approach to investing and for managing the Aquamarine Fund.</p>
<p><strong>Investment Philosophy:</strong> Spier&#x27;s investment philosophy is heavily influenced by Warren Buffett and Mohnish Pabrai. He believes in a very low-turnover, concentrated portfolio of high-quality businesses. He views himself as a co-owner of the businesses he invests in and takes a very long-term perspective.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Recent Talks and Insights:</strong> Spier often speaks about the importance of creating an optimal environment for decision-making and avoiding the &quot;noise&quot; of the market. His recent trades suggest a rotation within the natural resources sector. He continues to be a vocal proponent of long-term, patient investing.</p>
<h3>8. Robert Vinall, RV Capital</h3>
<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Robert Vinall is the founder of RV Capital and manages the Business Owner Fund. Based in Switzerland, he has a strong track record of outperformance by investing with a long-term, business-owner mindset.</p>
<p><strong>Investment Philosophy:</strong> Vinall&#x27;s approach, as the name of his fund suggests, is to think and act like a business owner. He invests in a concentrated portfolio of companies that he believes have strong fundamentals and are run by capable and aligned management teams.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Activity:</strong> In his 2024 letter to investors, Vinall discussed his investment in the oil sector, a new area for his fund, highlighting his willingness to invest in sectors he has not previously explored.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Talks and Insights:</strong> Vinall&#x27;s recent letter to investors was noted for its candor in discussing the emotional challenges of managing through significant drawdowns. He emphasized the importance of resilience and sticking to one&#x27;s investment philosophy. He also discussed his views on finding opportunities in Chinese tech.</p>
<h3>9. Bruce Berkowitz, Fairholme Capital</h3>
<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Bruce Berkowitz is the founder and Chief Investment Officer of Fairholme Capital Management. He is a deep-value, contrarian investor known for his highly concentrated and often unconventional investment bets. He was named Morningstar&#x27;s Domestic-Stock Fund Manager of the Decade for 2000-2009.</p>
<p><strong>Investment Philosophy:</strong> Berkowitz&#x27;s strategy revolves around buying unpopular assets at a deep discount to their intrinsic value. He is not afraid to take large, concentrated positions in out-of-favor sectors. His primary goal is long-term capital growth without taking on excessive risk, which he mitigates by paying a very low price for his investments.</p>

<li><strong>Significant Holdings:</strong> His portfolio is heavily concentrated in The St. Joe Co. and Enterprise Products Partners.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recent Talks and Insights:</strong> Berkowitz continues to advocate for a contrarian approach, focusing on the underlying facts of a business rather than market sentiment.

His recent portfolio moves indicate a strong belief in the recovery potential of the real estate and energy infrastructure sectors.</p>
<h3>10. Mohnish Pabrai, Pabrai Investment Funds</h3>
<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Mohnish Pabrai is an Indian-American investor, author, and philanthropist. He is a well-known proponent of &quot;cloning,&quot; or replicating the investment ideas of successful investors like Warren Buffett. He is the author of &quot;The Dhandho Investor.&quot;</p>

He runs a concentrated portfolio and is known for his patient, long-term approach.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Activity:</strong> Specific quarterly trades for Pabrai Investment Funds are publicly available through 13F filings.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Talks and Insights:</strong> Pabrai continues to be a vocal advocate for his cloning strategy, arguing that it is a powerful and underutilized tool for individual investors.

He has also shared his &quot;10 Commandments of Investing,&quot; which distill his value-oriented approach.</p>
<h3>11. Norbert Lou, Punch Card Management</h3>
<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Norbert Lou is the founder of Punch Card Management, an investment firm whose name is a direct nod to Warren Buffett&#x27;s famous &quot;20-slot punch card&quot; analogy for selective, high-conviction investing. Lou maintains a low public profile, letting the firm&#x27;s concentrated portfolio speak for itself.</p>
<p><strong>Investment Philosophy:</strong> Punch Card Management embodies an ultra-concentrated, long-term investment strategy. The philosophy is to invest in a very small number of exceptional businesses that the firm understands deeply and believes can compound capital at high rates over many years. This approach requires immense patience and a high threshold for what qualifies as an investment-worthy company.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Trades (as of Q1 2025):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Holdings Value:</strong> The firm&#x27;s 13F portfolio was valued at approximately $217 million.</li>

<li><strong>Recent Activity:</strong> Punch Card Management is known for its exceptionally low turnover. The most recent filings show no significant changes, underscoring their buy-and-hold-indefinitely approach. Their position in Smith &amp; Wesson Brands (SWBI) is a much smaller, long-standing holding.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recent Talks and Insights:</strong> Norbert Lou does not give public interviews or talks. His insights are communicated solely through his portfolio actions, which consistently demonstrate a belief in holding a few outstanding companies and doing very little trading.</p>

His firm is known for its flexible mandate, allowing it to invest across various asset classes, geographies, and parts of a company&#x27;s capital structure.

<h3>16. Clifford Sosin, CAS Investment Partners</h3>
<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Clifford Sosin founded CAS Investment Partners in 2012 after working as a sell-side analyst. He runs a highly concentrated, value-oriented portfolio and has generated exceptional returns since the fund&#x27;s inception.</p>
<p><strong>Investment Philosophy:</strong> Sosin&#x27;s approach is defined by extreme concentration. He often invests a massive portion of the fund&#x27;s assets in just one or two ideas. This strategy is predicated on exhaustive, deep-dive research to gain a significant informational edge. He looks for situations where he believes the market is fundamentally mispricing a business&#x27;s long-term prospects.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Trades (as of Q1 2025):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Holdings Value:</strong> CAS Investment Partners&#x27; 13F portfolio was valued at approximately $1.54 billion.</li>
<li><strong>Extreme Concentration:</strong> The portfolio is dominated by a massive, high-conviction bet on Carvana (CVNA). Other significant holdings include Hilton Grand Vacations (HGV) and Capital One Financial (COF).</li>
<li><strong>Recent Activity:</strong> Sosin has maintained his large position in Carvana through extreme volatility, demonstrating his long-term conviction in the company&#x27;s disruptive business model.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recent Talks and Insights:</strong> Clifford Sosin avoids the public spotlight. His actions, particularly his unwavering commitment to his Carvana investment, signal a belief that the market is overly focused on short-term challenges while ignoring the company&#x27;s potential to revolutionize the used car market.</p>
