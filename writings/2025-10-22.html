<p><em>October 21, 2025</em></p>
<h2>Forma and the Future of Solana Economic Zones</h2>
<p>Farhaj Mayan, co-founder of Forma, presented on the concept and progress of Solana economic zones (SEZs). Forma&#x27;s core mission is to work with <em>frontier countries and their governments</em> to develop these SEZs, which function as physical hubs designed to build economic relations between the cloud (Solana) and nation-states (LAN).</p>
<h3>Forma&#x27;s Extensive Track Record</h3>
<p>In the two years preceding the conference, Forma&#x27;s team traveled over 100,000 kilometers and hosted four pop-ups across three continents. Key achievements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing three long-term Solana hubs that actively engage with the local government and ecosystem.</li>
<li>Delivering over $5 million in foreign direct investment (FDI) through virtual events and long-term projects.</li>
<li>Generating over 10 million impressions on X (Twitter) through promotional videos created for these countries, helping to bring them to global attention.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Case Study: Kazakhstan Partnership</h3>
<p>Forma highlighted its most recent pop-up in Kazakhstan, calling it the <em>first ever formal official partnership</em> between a nation-state and the Solana network state.</p>
<p>Event Structure and Attendance:
The Kazakhstan engagement ran as a 1-day summit followed by a one-week trade mission coordinated directly with the national government. The live-streamed summit hoped to draw over 150,000 viewers. It was attended by over 250 government delegates, including national ministries, the national bank, and the securities commission.</p>
<p>Key Outcomes and Post-Event Impact:
During the event, four Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) were signed. Specifically, an MOU was signed with the Government of Kazakhstan and the Solana Foundation, officially recognizing and launching the Solana Economic Zone (SEZ) as the region&#x27;s first.</p>
<p>Since the event, significant developments have occurred:</p>
<ol>
<li>Digital Tenge Launch: Kazakhstan successfully launched its national currency stable coin, the <em>Digital Tenge</em>, on Solana.</li>
<li>Dual Listing Framework: The Astana International Exchange (AIX), which is NASDAQ-powered, signed an MOU with the Solana Foundation, Intabix, and Jupiter to develop a new framework allowing for the dual listing of public companies on Solana. This initiative aims to bring the liquidity of capital markets from the internet to the nation-state.</li>
<li>Developer Training: A national hackathon was delivered (in conjunction with Intabix), training over 1,000 developers on how to build on Solana.</li>
<li>Crypto City Announcement: Just 22 days prior to the conference, the President of Kazakhstan announced plans to establish a national crypto reserve and build a crypto city—a designated physical location for bleeding-edge blockchain innovation and payments.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Forma&#x27;s Future Direction</h3>
<p>Forma is moving away from the pop-up model and focusing on settling. The organization is in late-stage discussions with <em>three countries</em> (primarily in the Western Hemisphere) to establish long-term SEZs. The goal is to better match Forma&#x27;s objectives with the host governments&#x27; economic development goals.</p>
<p>Forma also announced its last pop-up village ever. This event will be held in Georgia from November 15 to 22. It is intended to host 150 members of the Solana community (and is open to all) to deliver a cultural experience and allow participants to beta test living in the country.</p>
<h2>Edge City: Incubating the Future of the Network State Movement</h2>
<p>Timour Coers introduced Edge City as a society incubator. Edge City&#x27;s primary mission involves three core activities: hosting <em>month-long pop-up villages</em> for those at the frontiers of tech, science, and culture; incubating and accelerating startups, new institutions, and entirely new fields of thought; and ultimately, building the infrastructure for the future of the network state movement.</p>
<h4>Track Record and Global Vision</h4>
<p>In less than two years, Edge City has achieved significant global reach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosted seven pop-ups across four continents.</li>
<li>Over 11,000 people have attended their events.</li>
<li>80 countries have been represented.</li>
<li>They have raised over $1 million in grants for early-stage builders.</li>
<li>The community is multigenerational, with over 150 kids attending. (A fun fact mentioned is that five children were conceived at or because of Edge).</li>
</ul>
<p>Edge City aims to create a global innovation network rather than replicate Silicon Valley (SF) elsewhere. Their hubs begin as temporary locations to run <em>interesting and radical experiments</em> and are intended to become permanent over time, with examples cited in California and Bhutan.</p>
<h4>Village Structure and Core Principles</h4>
<p>The villages are described as the &quot;highest leverage months of your year,&quot; gathering 500 to 1,000 curious, kind, and high agency people in an environment that maintains the dynamism of a city but the social fabric and size of a village. They focus on creating an environment for deep connection, recognizing that people must <em>care about each other enough</em> to start a new society together.</p>
<p>Edge City operates under four organizational principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Default Healthy: Emphasis on healthy food, time in nature, and daily workouts, ensuring everyone leaves healthier than they arrived.</li>
<li>Multi-disciplinary: Fostering innovation that emerges from the intersection of different fields.</li>
<li>Building and Co-creation: Promoting an ethos where everyone ships while at Edge, making the ecosystem &quot;open source in real life&quot;.</li>
<li>Multigenerational: Designing an environment where children can thrive, surrounded by top minds.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Incubation Success Stories</h4>
<p>Edge City serves as the best place for <em>rapid prototyping</em>, leading to several successful projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constellation: A startup founded by a Stanford Neuroscience PhD, Avery Creger, who ran a trial, collected one of the largest multimodal data sets of its kind, found his lead investor, and built his team all in 30 days.</li>
<li>Vasa Computation: Well-known theorist Mike Johnson found collaborators at Edge, helping unblock his applied research in the field of consciousness.</li>
<li>Decentralized Autonomous Corporations (DAC) Movement: Edge City has supported the DAC movement by helping shift it from theory to practice, organizing a grants program with Vitalik, and hosting a residency with Protocol Labs.</li>
<li>New Physical States: Edge is actively working to help build <em>Esmeralda</em>, a frontier tech family-friendly town one hour north of SF in California. They are also engaged with government officials in Bhutan regarding the site of the new Gilfu Mindfulness City project.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Upcoming Village and Future Focus</h4>
<p>Edge City&#x27;s next pop-up will be held in Patagonia from October 18th to November 15th of this year. They plan to transform a small town into a village, onboarding the majority of local businesses to crypto payments. The event will feature 16 different residencies (smaller sub-communities) and offer amenities like saunas, cold plunges, and deep workspace.</p>
<h2>Infinita: The Longevity Network State</h2>
<p>Niklas Anzinger, founder of Infinita, presented the vision for <strong>Infinita, the longevity network state</strong>. The fundamental goal is to drive <strong>massive biotech acceleration</strong> with the belief that curing aging is possible based on the laws of physics and available science and technology.</p>
<h4>The Biotech Problem and Call for Acceleration</h4>
<p>Infinita&#x27;s mission is motivated by the historical challenge of premature death resulting from a lack of access to life-saving drugs, citing the example of artist Keith Haring, who died from HIV when treatments were potentially available but restricted by agencies like the FDA. A significant structural problem currently plaguing biotech is that <strong>pharmaceutical R&amp;D returns have collapsed below the cost of capital</strong>. This collapse is occurring despite major advancements like GLP1s and mRNA vaccines, making it <em>“increasingly less scalable to build a biotech company”</em>.</p>
<h4>Physical Hubs and Jurisdictional Innovation</h4>
<p>Since drugs cannot be taken online, Infinita has established physical instantiation in the world.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prospera, Honduras:</strong> The main hub is located in Prospera, on the island of Rotan, Honduras. Prospera is highlighted as having the <strong>best legal system in the world</strong> and specifically allowing for <strong>medical freedom</strong>.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Infinita has brought <em>more than 1,500 people</em> and <strong>over 100 startups</strong> to Prospera.</li>
<li>They have funneled <strong>more than $20 million</strong> to those startups.</li>
<li>The community lives in the <strong>Duna Tower</strong>, a 14-story building that features a community lab and co-working space with solar punk art.</li>
<li>The <strong>mini circle gene therapy</strong> is available there, which Brian Johnson traveled to take, as documented in the <em>Don&#x27;t Die</em> Netflix documentary.</li>
<li>One startup operating in Prospera recently treated <strong>Kim Kardashian and Khloe Kardashian</strong> with their gene therapy.</li>
<li>Venture capitalist Tim Draper reportedly called the startup pitch competition hosted there the <strong>“highest density of great startups”</strong> he has ever witnessed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Montana Expansion:</strong> Infinita has recently expanded to work with innovative jurisdictions, including the state of Montana. Montana is promising for longevity treatments because it extends &quot;Right to Try&quot; laws—which allow patients access to unapproved but proven safe drugs—from applying only to terminally ill patients (as is standard elsewhere) <strong>to everyone</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Economic System</h4>
<p>The community utilizes the <strong>Lives Token</strong>, which functions as a stable coin backed payment token and a gateway to the community. The Lives Token is used for payments with <em>more than 40 different vendors</em> on Rotan for various items, including food, car rentals, and even mortgage payments. Users can earn benefits by completing tasks and transacting in this economy using the provided wallet and residency card tooling.</p>
<h4>The Infinite Games</h4>
<p>Infinita announced the upcoming <strong>Infinite Games</strong>, a major series of competitions and tournaments aimed at people who want to optimize their health, enjoy competition, and have fun.</p>
<ul>
<li>The games will include a <strong>Rejuvenation Olympics</strong>, where participants measure biomarkers, track health, and take part in competitions.</li>
<li>The national sport of Infinita City, <strong>Electric Knife Fighting (EKF)</strong>, will feature a championship (EKFC). This sport utilizes rubber knives equipped with tasers, similar to fencing.</li>
<li>Other events planned include a <strong>free diving world championship</strong>, poker tournaments, prediction markets tournaments, and cyberpunk paintball.</li>
<li>The Infinite Games are scheduled to take place next year throughout <strong>February and March</strong> on the beautiful island of Rotan, within the Prospera jurisdiction in Honduras.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Zuitzerland: Building a Permanent Village and Accelerator for Differential Acceleration (d/acc)</h2>
<p>Isla Munro-Hochmayr, the founder of Zuitzerland, introduced the project as building a <strong>permanent Swiss village</strong> and an <strong>accelerator for DAK</strong> (differential acceleration) and <strong>open source technology</strong>. The project seeks to create the <em>best place for people solving humanity&#x27;s biggest challenges</em>.</p>
<h4>Core Motivation: The Future of Humanity and Capital Allocation</h4>
<p>The project is heavily influenced by the essay &quot;My Techno-Optimism&quot; by Vitalik, which posits that the next decade is critical for humanity. The central question is whether accelerated technology leads to a future where humanity retains <strong>freedom, agency, and privacy</strong>, or one controlled by centralized companies and wealthy individuals.</p>
<p>Zuitzerland’s purpose is to allocate capital at a similar scale toward builders focused on <em>long-term, decentralized, democratic, differential</em> ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vision:</strong> The village is intended to be a <strong>shelling point for the future&#x27;s hundred billion dollar companies</strong>. It promotes a model where purpose is more than profit, but the two are not mutually exclusive, aiming to build entities like the next Ethereum or Uniswap.</li>
<li><strong>Legitimacy and Capital:</strong> The founders recognize that legitimacy is a powerful social technology. In the existing attention economy, capital is often allocated to things that manipulate attention, but the physical hubs being built are crucial because they create <strong>in-person legitimacy</strong> through <strong>tight social graphs</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Investable Model:</strong> Following a challenge from Vitalik to devise an <em>investable model</em>, Zuitzerland is developing a <strong>tokenized economy</strong>. This model would be piloted in Switzerland, with the goal of expanding into a transnational network of hubs. The token economy is designed to create value and upside that flows back into the ecosystem, operating like an endowment fund (e.g., Harvard or Stanford) but utilizing an <strong>economic flywheel on a token ecosystem</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why Switzerland?</h4>
<p>Switzerland was chosen as the pilot location because its cultural and historical framework aligns well with the project&#x27;s goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Governing Philosophy:</strong> If Silicon Valley&#x27;s motto is &quot;move fast and break things,&quot; Switzerland&#x27;s is &quot;<strong>move fast and try not to break things</strong>&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Decentralized Governance:</strong> Switzerland possesses a <strong>700-year history of decentralized governance</strong>, creating a powerful social and cultural technology aligned with d/acc.</li>
<li><strong>Talent and Commitment:</strong> The region has strong talent, including ETH, EPFL, the Zurich AI hub, and CryptoVal. Crucially, the Swiss government has committed to building all software as <strong>open source technology</strong> (within security limitations).</li>
</ul>
<p>Zuitzerland is positioning itself as <em>d/combinator</em>—a place for ambitious founders who <em>do not want to sell out</em>.</p>
<h4>Progress and Future Plans</h4>
<p>The project has demonstrated proof of concept:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Residency:</strong> In May, Zuitzerland ran its first residency at <em>Locks</em>, a ski resort, as a proof of concept for an onchain village.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Partnership:</strong> The success of the residency led to a long-term strategic partnership with Locks to develop a pilot that could bring the <strong>entire resort on chain next year</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Expansion:</strong> The team is also in discussions with Blockchain Zug and the canton, planning to collaborate with universities and researchers to establish a fully functioning <strong>onchain economy</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fireside Chat: Arthur Hayes and Balaji Srinivasan on Bitcoin, Macro Shifts, and the Code-Based Order</h2>
<p>The fireside chat featured Arthur Hayes (AH) and Balaji Srinivasan (B) discussing global economic trends, longevity, and the shift from traditional systems to decentralized networks.</p>
<h4><strong>The &quot;Get Your Bitcoin and Get Out&quot; Thesis and Macro Economics</strong></h4>
<p>Arthur Hayes elaborated on his quote, &quot;Get your Bitcoin and get out,&quot; arguing that global politicians consistently promise spending (e.g., more bombs, free healthcare, jobs) without raising taxes. The resulting funding mechanism is the printing of <strong>&quot;a fuck ton of money,&quot;</strong> which increases liquidity for Bitcoin and certain cryptocurrencies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Systemic Turning Point:</strong> Hayes believes the world is at an <strong>80-year turning point</strong> of massive change. Politicians attempt to limit volatility by printing money until the system &quot;explodes&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Exit Strategy:</strong> The advice is to convert earned fiat into assets like <strong>Bitcoin, gold, or great equities</strong> and &quot;exit stage left&quot; to stable jurisdictions such as Singapore or Dubai.</li>
<li><strong>Reserve Currencies:</strong> B noted that gold appears to be becoming the <strong>reserve currency of states</strong>, while <strong>Bitcoin</strong> is becoming the <strong>reserve currency of the network</strong>. AH confirmed that central banks are buying gold because they understand it as a protector of wealth. The ability of governments to print <em>infinite fiat</em> only became common in the 20th century, enabling funding for prolonged wars.</li>
<li><strong>Debt and the Fed:</strong> AH highlighted concerns about the US macro picture, specifically who will own the accumulating debt. He noted the Federal Reserve (Fed) is performing &quot;treasury buybacks&quot; (starting small, a few billion) which looks like the beginning of <strong>yield curve control</strong>. Since 2020, the Fed has refused to let any bond longer than 10 years mature or sell it, meaning there is <strong>no quantitative tightening</strong> on the long end of the yield curve.</li>
<li><strong>Tariffs and Scarcity:</strong> Tariffs amplify financial strain because they reduce the utility of the dollar by telling trade partners to stop selling things for printed money. AH suggested that US industrial policy, driven by the need to allocate credit to produce necessities like rare earths and chips, stems from the military realization that the US &quot;can&#x27;t actually win a war&quot;. B suggested that the US signals strength but the underlying substance is <strong>scarcity</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Shifting to the Code-Based Order</strong></h4>
<p>The conversation covered the shift from the traditional &quot;rules-based order&quot; to the more reliable <strong>&quot;code-based order,&quot;</strong> driven by Bitcoin and smart contracts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disrupting Banking:</strong> AH believes the <strong>banking system is &quot;very ripe to be completely disrupted&quot;</strong> by DeFi. Compliance, accounting, and cross-border money transfer can be done instantly for the cost of a gas transaction.</li>
<li><strong>Stable Coins as Licenses:</strong> B proposed that a <strong>stable coin</strong> functions as a <em>new kind of banking license</em>, allowing an entire financial UX (like Wells Fargo or Chase) to be built on a stable coin backend. Traditional banks&#x27; high valuations and huge employment numbers (e.g., 315,000 at JPMC) are sustained because they function as <em>arms of the government</em> and hold a crucial <strong>government license</strong>. Stable coins provide an <strong>unlocked network</strong> defense against the locked network of traditional banks.</li>
<li><strong>Identity and Sovereignty:</strong> B suggested that <strong>denaturalization</strong> (stripping citizenship) is the new debanking. Crypto offers a defense through Bitcoin (banking) and ENS/crypto identities (identity). AH observed that people have an emotional attachment to their birthplace identity (&quot;lottery ticket&quot;), but that choosing a crypto tribe (ETH, Solana, Bitcoin) is a <strong>stronger bond</strong> based on conscious choice and signing a &quot;social smart contract&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Longevity and Stem Cell Investment</strong></h4>
<p>Hayes is personally interested and involved in <strong>longevity</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Veritas Clinic:</strong> Two years prior, AH began researching stem cells and met Julian, the CEO of <strong>Veritas</strong> (a clinic near Thailand), in which he is now an investor and board member.</li>
<li><strong>Aim:</strong> Hayes aims to &quot;feel like I&#x27;m 30 for the rest of my life&quot;. The goal is to further research and commercialize stem cell treatments, hoping to lower prices over time.</li>
<li><strong>Medical Bravery:</strong> B praised AH&#x27;s willingness to take the personal health risk, calling it <strong>&quot;medical bravery,&quot;</strong> which is necessary to push for &quot;an ampic for longevity&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Balaji&#x27;s Vision: The Decentralized Country</strong></h4>
<p>Balaji shared his core ambition, stating that while others focus on Mars or AGI, he wants to <strong>start a new country</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Islands Separated by Internet:</strong> B envisions a <strong>decentralized country</strong> replacing &quot;islands separated by ocean&quot; (like Indonesia) with <strong>islands separated by internet</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Coordination and Peace:</strong> Coordination across distance is possible via teleresence, remote work, and drones. B believes this endeavor can be accomplished <strong>nonviolently</strong>, citing the independence of India and Singapore.</li>
<li><strong>No Army:</strong> The network state, backed by Bitcoin, would require &quot;no army&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Binance&#x27;s Global Vision and Strategy (Fireside with Richard Teng)</strong></h2>
<p>The CEO of Binance, Richard Teng, discussed the company&#x27;s priorities, its role in financial inclusion, and the geopolitical landscape of crypto regulation. Teng joined Binance in 2021.</p>
<h4>Company Scale and Focus</h4>
<p>Binance’s priority is always centered on its <strong>users</strong>, maintaining their trust and confidence. The company is aiming for a major milestone of <strong>1 billion users</strong> globally, building upon its current base of almost 300 million users.</p>
<p>Key organizational activities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rolling out new products, such as the enhanced <strong>Web3 wallet (Binance Alpha)</strong>.</li>
<li>Working with institutions (citing a partnership with Franklin Templeton) and ecosystem partners like stable coin issuers.</li>
<li>Being supportive of <em>all innovation</em> and collaborating globally with governments, institutions, and communities through events like hackathons.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Mission of Financial Inclusion</h4>
<p>Binance is currently the <strong>most regulated exchange globally</strong>, operating in about 22 different jurisdictions. The core mission, set by the founders, is to support the <strong>freedom of money</strong>.</p>
<p>This mission is crucial because Binance has significant traction in the developing world (the Global South, including Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East).</p>
<ul>
<li>Teng highlighted that <strong>1.4 billion people</strong> globally remain <em>unbanked</em>, lacking access to basic banking or payment systems.</li>
<li>Traditional finance has failed to solve this problem over the last 30 years.</li>
<li>Blockchain and crypto provide the <strong>only mode of payment</strong> for many in these regions.</li>
<li>Cross-border remittances are <strong>instantaneous</strong> and cost a fraction of traditional methods, which can take two days.</li>
<li>Crypto, including stable coins and Bitcoin, is a critical <strong>store of wealth</strong> for those experiencing hyperinflationary situations where their fiat currency depreciates sharply.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Superiority of Internet Capital Markets</h4>
<p>Binance is focused on the potential shift toward <em>Internet capital markets</em> becoming the largest in the world. Teng affirmed that the <strong>trajectory is tremendous and strong</strong> for this to happen.</p>
<p>The crypto system is deemed superior to traditional finance because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It provides <strong>atomic settlement</strong> (immediate clearing), eliminating clearing and settlement risks associated with traditional T+2 settlement.</li>
<li>It offers <strong>global liquidity</strong> that is accessible 24/7 from anywhere, unlike traditional centralized marketplaces. This access provides users with the best execution and lower slippage.</li>
<li>It eliminates many <em>middle and back office functions</em> of banks, such as reconciliation, which become unnecessary with blockchain technology.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Geopolitics and Regulatory Agility</h4>
<p>The regulatory environment significantly impacts capital flow globally, as demonstrated by the US shift toward being more pro-crypto, which compels other governments to pay attention to attract foreign direct investment and talent.</p>
<p>In terms of effective execution, Singapore and Middle Eastern countries like <em>Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Bahrain</em> are executing well.</p>
<p>A key advantage noted is that <strong>smaller countries</strong> are often <strong>more crypto friendly</strong> because they are <em>more nimble and agile</em> than large countries burdened by tedious regulatory processes involving multiple agencies. These small states are essentially <strong>startup countries</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Smaller states are willing to <strong>experiment</strong> because failure is contained, while success brings &quot;huge impact in terms of economic windfall&quot;.</li>
<li>Binance is actively helping institutions and countries set up <strong>strategic asset reserves</strong> in crypto (citing Bhutan and Kazakhstan as examples).</li>
<li>Countries with sovereignty (the ~200 UN-listed nations, plus special economic zones) can be approached to facilitate deals that modify laws in exchange for capital investment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bruno Macaes on Geopolitics, Technology, and the &quot;God Mode&quot; of World Building</h2>
<p>Bruno Macaes presented the core ideas of his 2025 book, <em><strong>World Builders</strong></em>, focusing on how geopolitical power is fundamentally changing through technology.</p>
<h4>The True Nature of Geopolitical Power</h4>
<p>Macaes argues that when analyzing geopolitics, one must shift perspective from the <em>agent</em> (or player) to the <strong>programmer</strong>. The world is far more <em>constructed</em> and <strong>virtual</strong> than commonly perceived.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition of Power:</strong> <strong>Geopolitical power is essentially the power to build a world</strong> or a virtual landscape that others are compelled to inhabit and operate within.</li>
<li><strong>Implicit Deception:</strong> Builders possess a powerful advantage if those operating within the system believe it is the <em>natural</em> or <em>inevitable</em> world, rather than a built one.</li>
<li><strong>The &quot;God Mode&quot; Concept:</strong> Geopolitical power is defined as the ability to enter the <strong>control panel of the global system</strong> and change its variables.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><em>Political power</em> is defined as playing the game.</li>
<li><em><strong>God mode</strong></em> is defined as changing the variables of the game state via the control panel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Real-World Example:</strong> The blocking of <strong>$300 billion in Russian central bank reserves</strong> during the war in Ukraine demonstrated this &quot;god mode,&quot; as the reserves existed merely as computer entries in Frankfurt or the New York Fed.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Technology and the Network State</h4>
<p>Macaes stressed that technology builders must recognize that they are creating the <em>framework</em> within which human life and political life operate, not just &quot;some gadgets&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coding the Game:</strong> The concept of the network state represents rising to the programmer&#x27;s perspective—where <strong>a superpower codes the game, and a normal power plays the game</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Fusion of Systems:</strong> Macaes asserts that <strong>geopolitics and technology are synonyms</strong>. The political system and the technological system operate in remarkably similar ways, noting the presence of key tech figures during events like Donald Trump&#x27;s inauguration.</li>
<li><strong>Power Inside the Network:</strong> Macaes views established powers (like the United States or China) as existing network states, but ones <strong>controlled from outside the network</strong>. Balaji&#x27;s network state concept aims to move power <em>inside</em> the network, promoting a structure that is decentralized and democratic.</li>
<li><strong>Origin of Ideas:</strong> The core ideas presented originated during a discussion Macaes had with Balaji while walking in Singapore approximately a year prior to the conference.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Multicurrency Mercantilism and the Shifting Global Monetary Order</strong></h2>
<p>Kathleen Tyson presented on the concept of <strong>Multicurrency Mercantilism</strong>. She noted that the idea, which was controversial when launched two years ago, is now considered <em>mainstream</em>. The fundamental transition in the global monetary order is recognized as real. The alternative to the dollar is defined not as a single replacement, but as <strong>&quot;the dollar and all other currencies&quot;</strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>The Decline of Dollar Dominance and Geopolitical Accelerants</strong></h4>
<p>While monetary transition can be gradual and stable, <strong>war accelerates the transition</strong>. Current geopolitical turmoil, including the war in Ukraine and the conflicts in Gaza and attacks on neighboring countries like Iran, Syria, Yemen, and Lebanon, is escalating wider war risks. These wider wars are simultaneously <strong>escalating US deficits</strong>, prompting people to flee from funding treasury markets.</p>
<p>The dollar has demonstrated underperformance, having dropped <strong>14% against other currencies</strong> and <strong>45% in gold terms</strong> over the past year.</p>
<h4><strong>The Evolving Multipolar World</strong></h4>
<p>Tyson argues that China is <strong>not going to be the next hegemon</strong>. China is currently the <em>leading trade partner</em> of over 150 states but actively treats its partners as sovereign. It is comfortable allowing trade to occur in renminbi, dollar, euro, or the partner&#x27;s own currency.</p>
<p>While countries in the United States and Europe perceive <em>fragmentation</em> because they are losing control, the other 7 billion people on the planet are experiencing <strong>unification, pacification, and collaboration</strong>. This process is accelerating development because these nations no longer require the West for capital, management, or education.</p>
<p>The <strong>Angel Paradox</strong> (the idea that sanctions harm the sanctioner as much as the sanctioned) has played out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sanctions on Russia have resulted in Russia experiencing significant growth, making it the <strong>fourth largest economy on the planet</strong>.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, Europe is rapidly <em>de-industrializing</em> due to energy costs that have doubled or trebled.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Technology, Reserves, and Stability Risks</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Technology</strong> is advancing rapidly, evidenced by new innovations like Deep Seek and a new <strong>salt battery out of China</strong> that can last up to 25 years while costing only 5-10% of previous batteries. China is now <em>completely technologically independent</em> of Western dependencies and is sharing its technology globally.</p>
<p><strong>Gold</strong> is seeing record prices, trading at <strong>$3,880 an ounce</strong>, with silver at $47. To bypass expropriation risks associated with London and New York, China announced it will use Hong Kong to <strong>vault official gold reserves</strong> purchased on the Shanghai gold exchange.</p>
<p>Regarding <strong>debt</strong>, private sector debt peaked in 2024 and is being squeezed out, which is <em>bad for growth</em>. However, public sector debt is still expanding at an accelerating rate. Instability is a serious risk, leading many countries to collaborate to preserve <strong>resiliency</strong>.</p>
<p>The capability exists for central banks to be multicurrency; the speaker affirmed they built a system operating in <strong>eight currencies across 12 depositories in real time</strong>. Central banks are expected to adopt this choice to spread risks and enhance systemic resiliency and liquidity.</p>
<p>Finally, the presentation concluded with a call for action: &quot;Those who love peace need to learn to organize as effectively as those who love war&quot;.</p>
<h2>Avik Roy on Expert Failure and Reforming Institutions via Exit</h2>
<p>Avik Roy’s presentation focused on analyzing the widespread <strong>failure of experts</strong> as the root cause of the <strong>greatest public policy failures of the 21st century</strong>. Roy draws on his background as a biotech investor, policy advisor, and opinion editor to analyze this pattern.</p>
<h4>The Repeatable Pattern of Expert Failure</h4>
<p>Major public policy disasters driven by expert consensus include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 2003 invasion of Iraq, fueled by intelligence experts convinced of WMDs.</li>
<li>The 2008 financial crisis, linked to macro experts like Alan Greenspan who believed the housing bubble was not a &quot;big deal&quot;.</li>
<li>The 2020 <strong>shutdown of society</strong>, which caused <strong>irreversible harm</strong> to children due to school closures in the U.S..</li>
</ul>
<p>This failure follows a <strong>repeatable pattern</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>An expert cites an <strong>actually true fact</strong> (e.g., coronaviruses are dangerous).</li>
<li>A <strong>sweeping prescription</strong> is made based on that fact (e.g., shut down society to achieve zero transmission).</li>
<li>Experts then gather their peers to <strong>kick out dissenters</strong> from advisory boards and the media, creating an illusion of <strong>unanimity among the credentialed</strong>.</li>
<li>Policymakers act on this false consensus, leading to policies that ultimately <strong>&quot;doesn&#x27;t work out&quot;</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Roy notes this pattern also applies to less massive failures, such as dietary experts recommending 11 servings of carbs daily, or pain experts pushing opioids.</p>
<h4>Necessary Reforms for Expert Success</h4>
<p>To reverse this pattern, Roy argues for structural changes that foster success:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legitimate Dissent:</strong> There must always be a role for dissenters in any expert community to <strong>test ideas</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Decentralized Policy Architecture:</strong> New societies need a system where people can <strong>experiment with different sets of rules</strong> and try various approaches to build innovative systems.</li>
<li><strong>Diversity of AI Models:</strong> Going forward, a diversity of AI models is essential to avoid the information control previously seen when Google and Wikipedia dominated access to information.</li>
<li><strong>Meritocracy:</strong> This prevents the compounding error where policymakers turn to the <em>same experts</em> who created a mess to fix it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Roy suggests that building new institutions is often easier than reforming existing ones, referencing Elon Musk&#x27;s sentiment that it is <strong>&quot;easier to go to Mars than it is to reduce the federal budget&quot;</strong>.</p>
<h4>Network States and the Expert Diaspora</h4>
<p><strong>Network states</strong> can take advantage of the <strong>expert diaspora</strong> leaving legacy societies to create better systems and economies. Specific areas for innovation include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Digital Assets:</strong> Since crypto <strong>will flow where it&#x27;s treated best</strong>, network states can implement better rules, forcing jurisdictions like the U.S. to respond.</li>
<li><strong>Energy:</strong> Network states can implement models for <strong>abundant energy</strong> creation using a <strong>lower carbon way</strong>, challenging the dogma of simply using less energy.</li>
<li><strong>Customized AI:</strong> AI models should be <strong>tailored to the unique needs</strong> and idiosyncrasies of network states.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare Reimaginaton:</strong> This is a key area for reform beyond the FDA. Network states can build new entities that allow for a <strong>more fluid way to take advantage of the workforce</strong> by changing credentialing for MDs and nurses in an AI-powered world. They can also redesign <strong>where</strong> healthcare is delivered, challenging the multi-trillion dollar hospital industry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Experts who leave legacy institutions can <strong>build new entities and paradigms</strong> in a network state setting, allowing everyone to benefit.</p>
<h2>Parag Khanna on the Age of Digital Nomads and the Passportal</h2>
<p>Parag Khanna, the founder of the geospatial data science company <strong>Alpha Geo</strong>, discussed the physics of human geography and the intensifying global <em>war for talent</em>. Khanna, who has traveled to <strong>more than 150 countries</strong>, operates on the modified axiom that one should only trust what they <em>experience firsthand</em>.</p>
<h4>The Physics of Human Mobility</h4>
<p>Khanna’s research, detailed in his book <em>Move</em>, examines what happens when the &quot;unstoppable force&quot; of <strong>migration</strong> meets the &quot;immovable object&quot; of <strong>borders</strong>. Currently, all drivers of human migration—including geopolitical turmoil, labor shortages, economic/technological displacement, and climate change—are &quot;in overdrive&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global Talent Recruitment:</strong> Despite narratives of nationalism and xenophobia, governments are engaged in an intense <strong>war for talent</strong>. The past decade has seen an <em>explosion</em> in programs like RBI, CBI, Golden Visas (e.g., the UAE Golden Visa, which Khanna helped develop) and <strong>digital nomad programs</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Relocation Trends:</strong> An estimated <strong>2.6 million people</strong> are expected to relocate this year, of which about <strong>150,000 are millionaires</strong>. This is creating a <em>new geography of wealth</em> as high net worth individuals move away from older centers. Alpha Geo, in partnership with Henley and Partners, is releasing a <strong>Global Investment Risk and Resilience Index</strong> to rank destinations based on stability and economic factors.</li>
<li><strong>The American Diaspora:</strong> The US now has a sizable diaspora of about <strong>7 million people</strong> abroad. Europe is actively recruiting US-based talent, and the credo of these moving Americans is often described as <em>liquidity, mobility, and optionality</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Scale of Movement:</strong> There are already <strong>over 300 million people</strong> living outside their country of origin (the highest number ever), a number expected to surge.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Introducing the Passportal</h4>
<p>Khanna noted that crossing borders remains the <strong>most overbureaucratized dimension of globalization</strong>. To solve this, he proposed the <strong>Passportal</strong>, a foundational platform for identity and mobility.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Principle:</strong> The Passportal is built on the principle that <strong>your identity belongs to you</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Function and Technology:</strong> It is envisioned as <em>identity as a service meets mobility as a service</em>. Its purpose is to function as the instrument for becoming a <strong>sovereign individual on the internet</strong>. It will assemble key components of societal identity into a <strong>secure blockchain ID wallet</strong>. The platform will utilize <strong>ZK (Zero-Knowledge) knowledge protocols</strong> for collecting credentials and attestations.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Impact:</strong> The Passportal is designed to <em>most effectively match supply and demand for labor</em> globally, a process that could potentially boost GDP by <strong>25%</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Monetization and Benefits:</strong> The platform will launch next year with pilot countries.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Individuals</strong> will pay a base user fee.</li>
<li><strong>Governments</strong> can massively streamline application vetting, issue e-visas, and cut billions spent on consular services.</li>
<li><strong>Corporates</strong> can use an <strong>AI matchmaking system</strong> to find desired workers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Platform Potential:</strong> The Passportal is a foundational platform that can support numerous added services, including insurance, relocation, healthcare, remittances, and skills training.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>The End of Nation States: A New Era of Neo-Medievalism</strong></h2>
<h3>Overview and Thesis</h3>
<p>This presentation argues that the world is being ushered into a new era of <strong>neo-medievalism</strong> due to technological forces that are <strong>weakening the established power of nation states</strong>. The central idea posits that the rise and fall of political structures are determined by which technologies allow for easy control and taxation.</p>
<h3>Historical Drivers: Fragmentation and Consolidation</h3>
<h4>The Fragmentation of the Middle Ages</h4>
<p>One of the key reasons why Europe was fragmented during the Middle Ages was the nature of <strong>farming</strong>, which generated wealth across <em>surfaces</em> (land) that were <strong>very hard to monitor</strong>. This difficulty in centralized monitoring allowed local lords to hold considerable power. Simultaneously, the Church maintained a <strong>monopoly on information and thought</strong>.</p>
<h4>Technological Drivers in the Rise of Nation States</h4>
<p>Over subsequent centuries, this fragmented system disappeared, replaced by nation states. The following technologies facilitated the rise of powerful, central states:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Information Control:</strong> The <strong>printing press</strong> generated a massive volume of content, which helped break the Church&#x27;s control (or &quot;chokehold&quot;) on information.</li>
<li><strong>Agricultural and Urban Shifts:</strong> The <strong>agricultural revolution</strong> resulted in the breeding of better horses and the creation of new inventions (like the horseshoe, horse collar, and heavy plow), leading to a <strong>massive increase in crop yields and population</strong>. The increased population migrated to <strong>cities</strong>, which are <em>points</em> rather than surfaces, making them <strong>much easier to control and tax</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Transportation and Choke Points:</strong> <strong>Ocean fairing ships</strong> enabled new empires that traded through <strong>Atlantic ports</strong>, which were easily controlled and taxed as choke points. Later, <strong>railroads and roads</strong> were also easy for nation states to control because they are natural monopolies built upon physical networks.</li>
<li><strong>Financial and Military Power:</strong> Improvements in mining technology increased the silver supply by four to five times, with those controlling <strong>mines</strong> (points) making immense wealth (e.g., the Habsburgs had a near-monopoly on silver). The need for financiers (like the Fuggers or Medici) and the escalation of military technology (cannons strengthening against fortresses, and vice versa) meant that <strong>only the richest states could afford big armies</strong> to overwhelm smaller ones.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Localization:</strong> Energy shifted from distributed, sun-based sources in medieval times (water, wind, wood, human food, animals) to sources like <strong>coal and oil</strong> in the 19th and 20th centuries, which were <strong>localized in geography</strong> and thus much easier to control.</li>
<li><strong>Centralized Media:</strong> Technologies like <strong>TV stations and radio stations</strong> became easier to control, reinforcing state power.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Weakening of Nation States</h3>
<p>The same technological forces that once strengthened nation states are now <strong>making them weaker</strong>. This trend is leading the world toward a new system of <em>neo-medievalism</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decentralized Connectivity:</strong> The <strong>internet</strong> can be beamed from anywhere.</li>
<li><strong>Global Communication:</strong> <strong>English is becoming the global language</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Freedom:</strong> The emergence of <strong>cryptocurrencies</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Decentralization:</strong> A shift back to <strong>solar</strong> as a source of energy.</li>
<li><strong>Geographic Independence:</strong> <strong>Remote work</strong> allows individuals to earn money while being <strong>uprooted from geography</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These modern forces reverse the historical trends, diminishing the control once held by centralized nation states.</p>
<h2>Fireside with Animoca&#x27;s Yat Siu: Funding Network States and Digital Ownership</h2>
<h3>I. Conference Context and Animoca&#x27;s Structure</h3>
<p>The discussion took place at the Network State Conference 2025, which Balaji characterized as &quot;much more <strong>zen</strong>&quot; and focused on &quot;deeper talks,&quot; place at the Network State Conference 2025, which Balaji characterized as &quot;much more <strong>zen</strong>&quot; and focused on &quot;deeper talks,&quot; contrasting it with the &quot;blingfest&quot; of the Token conference.</p>
<p>Yat Siu provided an overview of <strong>Animoca</strong>, describing it as a &quot;gigantic digital conglomerate&quot;. Animoca is one of the largest investors in the areas of <strong>crypto, blockchain, and gaming</strong>, holding over <strong>628 portfolio companies</strong>.</p>
<p>Crucially, Animoca is <strong>not a fund</strong>; it operates using <em>prop capital</em> (proprietary capital). While traditional tech giants (like Google or Apple) focus on extraction, Animoca’s model dictates that <strong>&quot;every profit that we make goes back into the ecosystem to develop it out more,&quot;</strong> positioning it almost like an ecosystem fund or a network structure similar to the South Korean <em>chaebols</em>. Animoca thinks about its operations in terms of building an economy and using <strong>GDP</strong> as a metric.</p>
<h3>II. Blockchain, Governance, and Self-Organization</h3>
<p>The rise of crypto has fostered a deep, common culture across corporate boundaries, rooted in shared values like <strong>decentralization</strong> and <strong>self-sovereign keys</strong>.</p>
<p>Blockchain is seen as providing a <strong>scaling form of self-organization</strong> and a reliable <strong>enforcement mechanism</strong> for society. Everyone involved in crypto has essentially <strong>consented to the laws of crypto</strong> and the specific chain they use, creating a chosen jurisdiction.</p>
<p>A monumental achievement demonstrating this self-organization was the <strong>Ethereum transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake (The Merge)</strong>. Balaji was &quot;stunned&quot; that this highly complex engineering feat occurred <strong>&quot;seamlessly,&quot;</strong> defeating typical intuitions about how both software and human organization are supposed to work.</p>
<p>The underlying philosophy is that human organization, while driven by self-interest, ultimately aims to benefit most of society, which Balaji terms <strong>&quot;win and help win,&quot;</strong> representing crypto at its best.</p>
<h3>III. Gaming, Ownership, and Virtual Economies</h3>
<p>The <strong>gaming industry</strong> is massive, engaging <strong>3.4 billion people</strong> regularly. The panelists noted the historical significance of gaming: the entire <strong>GPU industry</strong>, essential for Bitcoin mining and today&#x27;s AI technology, arose from the &quot;whimsical experience&quot; of wanting better graphics for games.</p>
<p><strong>Key Concepts in Gaming as Network Societies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scale:</strong> Games like <strong>Roblox</strong> (380 million users) and <strong>Minecraft</strong> (160–180 million users) are already massive network societies.</li>
<li><strong>User-Generated Content (UGC):</strong> The top two games (Roblox and Minecraft) rely on UGC and the ability for users to run their own servers and mod communities.</li>
<li><strong>Ownership:</strong> The core differentiator is <strong>ownership</strong>—the idea that players have a stake or a sense of ownership in the assets, which transcends mere content consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Macroeconomic Experiments:</strong> Games like <strong>Second Life</strong> and <strong>Eve Online</strong> have persisted for almost 20 years because they operate like &quot;island states&quot; with their own economies, communities, and ownership structures. Virtual economies have served as the first experimental subjects for macroeconomics, allowing simulations of entire economies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Problem of Inflation:</strong> Gaming companies often act as the <strong>&quot;worst in QE&quot;</strong> (Quantitative Easing) by constantly inflating their internal economy. This inflation causes games to &quot;die&quot; because new, casual gamers cannot afford the inflated assets, preventing the game from expanding beyond its core community. This economic challenge mirrors real-world systems, such as <strong>airline miles</strong>, which operate as a high-margin virtual currency business that in some ways subsidizes the physical airline operation.</p>
<h3>IV. Digital Assets and Identity</h3>
<p>Balaji suggested that the Web3 overlap might be better served by <strong>gamifying work</strong> rather than <em>workifying games</em>. Yat Siu confirmed that many Asian gamers want to own their assets.</p>
<p><strong>Tokenization</strong> is a key mechanism that opens up the market structure. Tokenizing gaming assets is viewed as a form of <strong>RWA (Real World Asset) tokenization</strong>, even though it is digital-to-digital.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Identity</strong> is deemed critical:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ENS</strong> (Ethereum Name Service) and <strong>SNS IDs</strong> are seen as portable NFTs that are ready for prime time.</li>
<li>Digital IDs allow users to <strong>export their reputation</strong> (e.g., Uber star ratings) between different platforms and ecosystems, unlocking reputation that is currently &quot;locked in Apple, it&#x27;s locked in Facebook, it&#x27;s locked in Steam&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h3>V. Funding the Future</h3>
<p>Yat Siu affirmed that Animoca is actively looking at investments in startup societies and network states. He stated that <strong>&quot;everything we do... is all about funding network states and network societies and making them grow,&quot;</strong> as they view this as the future.</p>
<h2>Fireside with Jacqueline Poh, CEO of Singapore&#x27;s JTC: Industrial Policy and Strategic Growth</h2>
<h3>I. JTC&#x27;s Role and Scope</h3>
<p>**## Fireside with Jacqueline Poh, CEO of Singapore&#x27;s JTC: Industrial Policy and Strategic Growth</p>
<h3>I. JTC&#x27;s Role and Scope</h3>
<p><strong>JTC (Jurong Town Corporation)</strong> is Singapore&#x27;s <strong>largest industrial landlord for business</strong>. It manages approximately <strong>$40 billion</strong> in assets under management (AUM). JTC effectively manages the <strong>real estate piece of Singapore&#x27;s industrial policy</strong>.</p>
<p>JTC is responsible for creating and managing extensive industrial and mixed-use districts, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>one-north:</strong></em> A mixed-use district home to companies like Grab and Razer, and the location of <strong>Launchpad</strong>, Singapore&#x27;s largest startup ecosystem with over <strong>700 startups</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Punggol Digital District</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Jurong Island:</strong> Where a massive data center park is being constructed.</li>
<li>Facilities dedicated to <strong>biomed</strong>, medtech, and <strong>wafer fab parks</strong>.</li>
<li>The electronics and semiconductors sector makes up <strong>7% of Singapore&#x27;s GDP</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>II. Economic Strategy and Governance</h3>
<p>Singapore, a relatively young nation celebrating its 60th birthday in 2025, is currently undergoing a significant economic strategy review. The government is questioning whether solely relying on <strong>MNC-led growth</strong> is sustainable in a more fragmented and deglobalized world. The main aim is to build and <strong>headquarter globally leading companies in Singapore</strong> to provide good jobs and benefit from the country&#x27;s innovation ecosystem.</p>
<p>Key attributes of Singapore&#x27;s governance supporting this strategy include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agility:</strong> The government is highly <strong>&quot;joined up&quot; and linked together</strong>, which enables it to provide a strong proposition.</li>
<li><strong>Pro-Business Environment:</strong> Companies can be <strong>registered in about a day or so</strong> (sometimes while the founder is in transit at Changi Airport).</li>
<li><strong>Technology:</strong> The digital identity app, <em><strong>SingPass</strong></em>, is cited as a very functional government technology product.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Planning:</strong> Singapore has a roughly <strong>30-year head start on industrial policy</strong> compared to other countries that only recently adopted it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>III. Attracting Global Talent</h3>
<p>Singapore views <strong>global tech talent as a competitive advantage</strong>. Initiatives specifically created to draw in founders and capital include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tech Pass and One Pass:</strong> Balaji was the first recipient of the <strong>Tech Pass</strong>. This scheme was later expanded into the <strong>One Pass</strong>, which is a <strong>five-year visa with no residency requirements</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Spousal Employment:</strong> The One Pass allows individuals who are founders, VCs, or capital holders to bring their spouses, and the spouses are permitted to work on the same visa.</li>
</ul>
<h3>IV. Economic Pillars and Conscious Management</h3>
<p>Singapore maintains a complex and diverse economy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manufacturing</strong> accounts for <strong>20% of Singapore&#x27;s GDP</strong>. This includes high-value, high-tech manufacturing, such as <strong>semiconductors, bio-pharmaceuticals, and medical devices</strong>, often utilizing high robotics and digital twins.</li>
<li><strong>Finance</strong> is only <strong>15% of GDP</strong>, despite Singapore being one of the world&#x27;s top five financial hubs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The government consciously manages the economic ecosystem, leaning <strong>against the natural market tendency</strong> for the high salaries in finance to draw away all top engineers and talent. This commitment to manufacturing is sustained because the government believes it is important for <strong>resilience and diversity</strong>.</p>
<p>JTC focuses on attracting companies in key tech areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI:</strong> Singapore produces <strong>100 AI PhDs a year</strong>. AI is expected to transform manufacturing, logistics, and port/airport operations. The government is increasingly using <strong>AI</strong> for competitive analysis and consciously managed processes.</li>
<li><strong>Autonomous Vehicles (AVs):</strong> Singapore is undertaking a <strong>&quot;big push&quot; on AV deployments</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Biotech and Medtech</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>V. The Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ)</h3>
<p>To overcome limitations in land and manpower, Singapore partnered with Malaysia to develop the <strong>Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ)</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> The border between Johor and Singapore is the <strong>world&#x27;s busiest land crossing</strong>. A <strong>Rapid Transit System (RTS) train</strong> will soon connect the two, carrying approximately <strong>10,000 people an hour</strong> in 5–10 minutes. JTC is developing the Singapore side, the <em><strong>Woodlands Gateway</strong></em>.</li>
<li><strong>Scope and Resources:</strong> The zone covers most of Southern Johor, an area many times the size of Singapore. This arrangement is <strong>complementary</strong>: Singapore provides <strong>trust capital, the financial center, innovation, and top universities</strong>; Malaysia provides <strong>manpower and land</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Goals:</strong> The partnership is committed to over <strong>50 projects</strong> to attract companies that would not have considered either country alone. The goal is to create at least <strong>20,000 jobs in Johor</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Network of States: Operationalizing the Network State via Network Cities</h2>
<h3>I. The Core Problem with Network States</h3>
<p>The presentation addresses the fundamental challenge facing the <strong>network state</strong> concept as originally conceived: the need for <strong>public goods</strong> and <strong>scale</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public Goods:</strong> A dispersed human network cannot easily provide essential services like <strong>infrastructure</strong> or <strong>physical security/defense</strong>; these are typically provided by host countries.</li>
<li><strong>Scale:</strong> A traditional state needs <strong>scale</strong> for crucial elements like <strong>investment</strong>, <strong>trade</strong>, and attracting <strong>skilled professionals</strong> in a globalized economy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>II. The Solution: Network Cities (A Network of Hong Kongs)</h3>
<p>The proposed solution is the concept of <strong>Network Cities</strong>. These cities are envisioned as a <strong>global network of semi-autonomous communities</strong> or <strong>entrepôts</strong> that coordinate via the internet.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Model:</strong> The concept is inspired by <strong>pre-2019 Hong Kong</strong>. Hong Kong successfully operated under a <em>one country, two systems</em> arrangement, giving it its <strong>own laws</strong> and <strong>own currency</strong>—it was <strong>autonomous but not independent</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Scale:</strong> If enough cities join, this single network state would encompass over <strong>100 million people</strong>, creating an <strong>incredibly powerful network state</strong> globally.</li>
<li><strong>Ecosystem:</strong> This large network state would create the space for the <strong>other human networks</strong> (the communities originally envisioned by Balaji) to exist inside it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>III. The Symbiotic Relationship with Host Countries</h3>
<p>The relationship between the <strong>Network City</strong> and the <strong>host country</strong> is designed to be <strong>symbiotic</strong> (a &quot;win-win situation&quot;).</p>
<p>| Entity | Role/Incentive | Support |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <strong>Host Country</strong> | Provides <strong>security</strong> and <strong>national defense</strong>. The host is incentivized because the city routes massive <strong>trade and investment</strong> to them. | Examples: Every country—including Indonesia, Brazil, Nigeria, and the EU—could host one (like Macau is hosted by China). |
| <strong>Network City</strong> | Provides its own internal <strong>public goods and infrastructure</strong>. | The city builds its <strong>own trains, water systems, sewage systems, and telecom</strong>. |</p>
<p>The network state in this symbiotic model is <strong>not seen as parasitical</strong> but rather mutually beneficial.</p>
<h3>IV. Mobility and Network Enforcement</h3>
<h4>Free Movement</h4>
<p>A critical feature is the <strong>free movement of people, capital, and everything like that between</strong> the Network Cities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal Mobility:</strong> Residents of one Network City would be <strong>free to move automatically</strong> to any of the other cities around the world (e.g., in Brazil, Europe, or anywhere else).</li>
<li><strong>Restricted Mobility:</strong> Movement (population mobility) would be <strong>restricted between the city and the mainland</strong> of the host country.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Network Punishment</h4>
<p>To mitigate the risk of a host country absorbing and conquering its Network City (as China did to Hong Kong in 2019):</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>large global network of entrepôts</strong> would coordinate to <strong>reroute trade and finance</strong> around the offending country.</li>
<li>This network punishment would cause the host country to <strong>lose out on investment and trade</strong> brought by the city.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Precedent:</strong> This defense mechanism is modeled after the <strong>Hanseatic League</strong> (1200s–1400s), a league of German merchants who used their network power to famously <strong>punish the city of Bruge</strong> for blocking their trade.</li>
</ul>
<h3>V. Operationalizing Finance and Governance</h3>
<p>A <strong>large holding company</strong> could be established, potentially <strong>headquartered in Singapore</strong> or operating <strong>on the blockchain</strong>, to coordinate <strong>investment and trade finance</strong> between all the Network Cities.</p>
<p>The creation of the Network of Cities is seen as a combination of the ideas of <strong>network states</strong> and <strong>charter cities</strong>, solving all the &quot;thorny questions&quot; of network state operation simultaneously. It opens the possibility for a <strong>new kind of state</strong> to coexist peacefully with existing traditional states in the age of the internet.</p>
<h2>El Salvador: From Homicide Capital to Bitcoin Country</h2>
<h3>I. National Rebrand and Economic Strategy</h3>
<p>Stacy Herbert, the <strong>Director of the National Bitcoin Office of El Salvador</strong>, highlights the country&#x27;s transformation as <strong>&quot;one of the greatest rebrands in history&quot;</strong>. El Salvador went from being known as the <strong>homicide capital of the world</strong> to being recognized globally as <strong>Bitcoin country</strong>. The shift in public perception is described as &quot; known as the <strong>homicide capital of the world</strong> to being recognized globally as <strong>Bitcoin country</strong>. The shift in public perception is described as &quot;crazy&quot;.</p>
<p>The country&#x27;s economic focus is on <strong>building capital markets on Bitcoin</strong>. This strategy is based on the recognition that a country cannot become a global economic powerhouse without <strong>capital</strong>. El Salvador views Bitcoin as providing a <strong>competitive advantage</strong>. Despite initial <strong>&quot;blowback from the global powers&quot;</strong> when Bitcoin was first adopted as legal tender, President Bukele maintained this vision.</p>
<h3>II. Attracting Builders and Global Talent</h3>
<p>El Salvador is actively working to attract <strong>global digital nomads and tech startups</strong> through several initiatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tax Incentives:</strong> The country is offering <strong>0% tax for industries</strong> that establish themselves there.</li>
<li><strong>Government Responsiveness:</strong> The government is described as <strong>&quot;very responsive, fast acting&quot;</strong> and able to quickly address the needs of entrepreneurs.</li>
<li><strong>Immigration:</strong> El Salvador is introducing <strong>easy pathways to citizenship</strong>. Tourists can easily visit and stay, as the standard tourist visa allows one to stay for <strong>180 days</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>III. Governance Model and Optimism</h3>
<p>The presentation emphasizes two key aspects of the country&#x27;s governance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security Model:</strong> The <strong>&quot;Boulli model on security has swept Latin America,&quot;</strong> suggesting that its disciplined approach is inspiring other countries.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Framework:</strong> El Salvador has a <strong>trailblazing pioneering brand and reputation</strong>. For instance, the <strong>regulatory framework for AI is &quot;super streamlined,&quot;</strong> with a simple law accompanied by regulations that are <strong>just 13 pages</strong> long. This streamlined technological framework is explicitly noted as <strong>inspiring other countries</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For builders and those interested in network states, El Salvador offers a <strong>huge sense of optimism</strong>. This environment, where people are generally happy and building, contrasts sharply with places where people may feel depressed or that things are getting worse. The Director encourages people to abide by the phrase <strong>&quot;don&#x27;t trust, verify&quot;</strong> and to <strong>come and visit El Salvador and build there</strong> for themselves.</p>
<h2>Expo City Dubai: Pioneering a City Operating System and Open Platform</h2>
<h3>I. Expo City Overview and Special Economic Zone Status</h3>
<p><strong>Rashid Mohammed, the CTO of Expo City Dubai</strong>, introduced the project, noting that the site previously hosted <strong>Expo 2020</strong>, which attracted over <strong>24 million visits</strong>. The infrastructure was purpose-built, and approximately <strong>80% was retained</strong> when the site was converted into Expo City Dubai.</p>
<p>Expo City Dubai is an <strong>ambitious city</strong> with a strategy aimed at changing the way cities live and move forward. A key feature is that it is the <strong>newest created free zone in Dubai</strong>, making it a <strong>special economic zone within the UAE</strong>. This status grants the city the ability to change or set its own laws.</p>
<h3>II. The Open Platform for Innovation</h3>
<p>Expo City functions as an <strong>open platform for companies to come and test</strong> innovations. It is designed to be an ecosystem that supports startups and innovative companies that serve a city.</p>
<ul>
<li>The city comprises a <strong>huge cluster of 163 buildings</strong>.</li>
<li>Startups can replicate and test technologies within the city.</li>
</ul>
<h3>III. The Aspiration for a City Operating System (City OS)</h3>
<p>Rashid Mohammed emphasized that the <strong>logical element</strong> (the operational stack) of city management and buildings is <strong>outdated</strong>. Expo City aspires to change this by creating a fundamental new system for city operations.</p>
<p>The goal is to develop a <strong>City Operating System (OS)</strong>. This OS would be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open-source</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Not locked</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Hardware-agnostic</strong>, supporting all protocols.</li>
</ul>
<p>This open OS would allow pure software startups with ideas (e.g., facial recognition, power recognition) that are connected to an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system to easily <strong>deploy</strong> their innovations, even if they do not own the hardware.</p>
<h3>IV. Focus on Human-Centric Services and Lifestyle 3.0</h3>
<p>The underlying technological overhaul is necessary because existing management stacks are built for office workers, <strong>not for the people who run the city on the ground</strong>.</p>
<p>The CTO stated that, in the coming years, the most expensive piece will be the <strong>physical person moving from point A to point B</strong> to perform a task or move equipment. The technical infrastructure needs a <strong>granular level revamp</strong> that has never been done before.</p>
<p>Expo City aspires to transition to a <strong>human-centric, intuitive service</strong>. The project seeks to define <strong>lifestyle 3.0</strong> in a city, contemplating whether this future is still an app or if the service becomes intuitive, requiring no app at all. Expo City is seeking collaboration, potentially from network schoolers, to help build this City OS.</p>
<h2>Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM): A Pioneering, Agile Financial Regulator</h2>
<h3>I. Overview and Founding Context</h3>
<p><strong>Wai Lum Kwok</strong> presented on the role and journey of the <strong>Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM)</strong>, the international financial center of Abu Dhabi.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Establishment:</strong> ADGM was set up in <strong>October 2015</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Framework:</strong> It operates under <strong>English common law</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Mission:</strong> ADGM was established to support Abu Dhabi&#x27;s <strong>economic diversification strategy</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Starting from Scratch:</strong> When ADGM began in 2015, the regulator had the opportunity to <strong>start from scratch</strong>, meaning they had <strong>no legacy issues</strong> and could build regulations by importing best practices from around the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>The regulator noted that, unlike some equivalent bodies, it does <em>not</em> fulfill a central banking role.</p>
<h3>II. Pioneering Crypto Regulation</h3>
<p>ADGM recognized early on that the future of financial services would be <strong>technology-enabled</strong>. ADGM was one of the <strong>earliest regulators globally to regulate the crypto space</strong>, issuing its framework in <strong>June 2018</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Addressing Risk:</strong> At the time, the global conversation was focused heavily on money laundering and financial crime. ADGM benchmarked its efforts against the New York Department of Financial Services and Japanese regulators.</li>
<li><strong>Institutional Approach:</strong> Institutional investors indicated they would only enter the space if all risks were addressed.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Framework:</strong> ADGM&#x27;s framework <strong>extends traditional financial regulations to carve in crypto assets</strong> by treating them as <strong>&quot;just another asset class&quot;</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Ecosystem Growth:</strong> Today, ADGM hosts a young ecosystem that includes broker-dealers, exchanges, custodians, stablecoin issuance, and prime brokers.</li>
<li><strong>Sovereign Support:</strong> The Abu Dhabi government&#x27;s <strong>sovereign wealth funds</strong> played a role by <strong>investing in key foundational players</strong> to establish the base layer of the crypto ecosystem. This includes dipping their toes into <strong>mining</strong>, which helps create <strong>risk capital for borrowing and lending</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>III. Regulatory Innovation and Agility</h3>
<p>ADGM employs three pillars in its development, with the first being <strong>anticipating the future</strong> and remaining <strong>agile</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yield-Bearing Stablecoins:</strong> ADGM <strong>deliberately allows for yield-bearing stablecoins</strong>. While most other regimes prohibit this purely from a financial perspective, ADGM realized that institutional investors prefer using them as a <strong>form of collateral</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Formalizing Regulation:</strong> ADGM continues to formalize rules, with a consultation paper for <strong>staking</strong> recently released, and plans to formalize rules for <strong>VA borrowing and lending</strong> in the next two quarters.</li>
<li><strong>Industry Reliance:</strong> ADGM moved away from a strict approval-based regime for crypto assets toward greater <strong>reliance on the industry</strong> to conduct their own due diligence.</li>
</ul>
<h3>IV. The Regulatory Sandbox</h3>
<p>A key tool for ADGM&#x27;s ability to adapt and adjust policy is its <strong>sandbox</strong>. This is a designated place for the regulator to <strong>experiment with policies</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On-Chain Innovation:</strong> ADGM currently hosts a firm that issues <strong>on-chain credit</strong> where <strong>everything is native</strong> (e.g., auction processes, borrowing, and lending occur in the on-chain environment). This firm bypasses the need to tokenize paper-based real-world assets.</li>
</ul>
<h3>V. Global Engagement</h3>
<p>ADGM participates in global standard-setting bodies like <strong>IOSCO and BCBS</strong>. It exercises thought leadership by bringing global regulators together to converse and seek <strong>regulatory harmony</strong>.</p>
<p>ADGM organizes the <strong>Abu Dhabi Finance Week</strong> every year to connect traditional finance (TradFi), new finance (NewFi), and sustainable finance on the same platform over four days. This event typically occurs after the Formula 1 Abu Dhabi race in early December.</p>

<p>The presentation introduces a historical vision of Web3 and crypto based on the study of macro historians. The core hypothesis is the <strong>&quot;pulsation of the commons,&quot;</strong> which argues that civilization has forgotten about the <strong>commons</strong>—the third most important institution, alongside the state and the market.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cyclical Nature:</strong> Historically, markets and states are seen as perpetually switching dominance (&quot;back and forth&quot;). However, the health of the commons operates cyclically: when markets and states <strong>do well, the commons go down</strong>. Conversely, when markets and states <strong>start functioning less and go down, the commons go up</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Hegemony in Dark Ages:</strong> Most interestingly, when a <strong>dark age</strong> occurs and markets and states almost completely disappear, the <strong>commons become hegemonic</strong>. This is evidenced by the role of monasteries in the revival of Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire, and Buddhist monastics in China and Japan.</li>
</ul>
<h3>II. Historical Forms of the Commons</h3>
<p>Throughout history, the commons served to balance the <strong>&quot;extractive exaggerations&quot;</strong> of the market and state, which constantly compete with each other and overuse their land base.</p>
<p>| Historical Period | Form of Commons | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <strong>Indigenous Period</strong> | Communal shareholding and the gift | These were the main value exchange systems; markets and the state were marginal or non-existent. |
| <strong>Pre-Capitalist/Medieval</strong> | Common land (Physical Commons) | In the European Middle Ages, common land was managed by the village and was crucial alongside the lord&#x27;s land and the farmer&#x27;s own land. |
| <strong>Modernity (16th Century)</strong> | Enclosures/Statification | The <strong>physical commons were destroyed</strong> by the enclosures of the 16th century. Displaced farmers moved to cities and created the <strong>social commons</strong> (e.g., welfare organizations of labor), which subsequently underwent <strong>statification</strong> to become the welfare state. |</p>
<h3>III. The Digital Commons and Revival</h3>
<p>The commons experienced a major revival starting in the late 20th century:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1993: Digital Knowledge Commons:</strong> The democratization of digital networks created vast <strong>digital knowledge commons</strong>, bringing the concept back into the consciousness and practice of millions of people.</li>
<li><strong>2008: Urban and Rural Commons:</strong> Following the financial crash, loads of young people facing high unemployment (30% to 50% in some European countries) created a <strong>massive amount of urban and rural commons</strong>. One study noted that a single city went from 50 urban commons to 500 in just ten years.</li>
</ul>
<h3>IV. Cosmolocalism and the Role of Crypto</h3>
<p>The presentation concludes with the concept of <strong>Cosmolocalism</strong> and a proposal for integrating Web3 with local regenerative efforts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Cosmolocalism is the combination where <strong>&quot;everything that&#x27;s heavy is local, is relocized, and everything that&#x27;s light is global and shared&quot;</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Critique of Crypto Exit:</strong> The speaker views crypto primarily as an <strong>exit strategy</strong>, which is <strong>&quot;very dangerous&quot;</strong> if only used for arbitrage of territory and moving around. If crypto communities are not seen as an ally of local people, they risk <strong>rejection</strong> during civilizational change.</li>
<li><strong>Proposal for Integration:</strong> The movement needs to create a link between the <strong>coordination capacity of code and capital of Web3</strong> and the <strong>regenerative efforts of millions of people locally</strong> who are trying to heal their land and soil.</li>
<li><strong>Vision:</strong> The goal is to establish some form of <strong>fragmented or fractal capital</strong> that would allow <strong>investment of crypto capital into local regenerative projects</strong> that are &quot;commons compatible&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fireside with Polychain&#x27;s Olaf Carlson-Wee: Why Now is the Time for Network States</h2>
<h3>I. The Network State as a Post## Fireside with Polychain&#x27;s Olaf Carlson-Wee: Why Now is the Time for Network States</h3>
<h3>I. The Network State as a Post-Bitcoin Evolution</h3>
<p>Olaf Carlson-Wee, the founder of Polychain, approaches the concept of network states and startup societies from an <strong>investment perspective</strong> and a <strong>cryptocurrency mechanism design perspective</strong>.</p>
<p>He asserts that the movement is transitioning from a &quot;pre-Bitcoin sort of startup society ecosystem&quot; to the equivalent of <strong>&quot;really Bitcoin&quot;</strong>. Historically, before Bitcoin, there were prototypes (like ecash, hash, bit gold, and Liberty Reserve) that were directionally correct but lacked the key components needed to succeed. The network state movement is now at that tipping point.</p>
<p>Balaji characterizes this movement as the <strong>&quot;third kind of thing&quot;</strong> after internet companies and internet currencies, calling them <strong>internet communities</strong>.</p>
<h3>II. The Dramatic Shift to Internet-Native Populations</h3>
<p>A major &quot;macro tailwind&quot; driving the current opportunity is the shift in generational adoption of the internet:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>150x Growth:</strong> Between 1995 and 2010, the number of people who grew up with an internet connection <strong>grew by 150 times</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Internet First:</strong> This &quot;new generation&quot; is genuinely <strong>internet first</strong>, viewing the internet as their <strong>home</strong> or &quot;native place&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Smartphone Ideology:</strong> Balaji notes that 20th-century ideologies were based on the assembly line; today, every ideology must start on the <strong>smartphone</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This shift explains <strong>&quot;why now&quot;</strong>. Since more people are organizing via <strong>online networks instead of geography</strong>, the reliance on geographically organized systems—like fiat money and regulatory frameworks—becomes increasingly odd for online businesses. This situation is likened to having <strong>region-locked electronics</strong> or a <strong>region-locked Gmail account</strong> when crossing borders.</p>
<h3>III. Speedrunning the Dubai and Singapore Models</h3>
<p>The success of Dubai and Singapore proves the demand for a model based on governance and trade. These regions, which lacked natural resources, became the highest-growth economies by opening themselves up to <strong>globalization, free trade</strong>, and making themselves good places to live and do business.</p>
<p>The difference now is the availability of <strong>the internet and cryptocurrency</strong>, which provides <strong>incentive design and mechanism design</strong>. Network states can now <strong>speedrun</strong> the story of Dubai and Singapore significantly faster, potentially achieving similar growth in <strong>10 or 15 years</strong>, rather than multiple decades.</p>
<p>The massive scale of modern internet communities (e.g., WhatsApp, YouTube, TikTok are &quot;billion person apps&quot;) shows the potential for groups to organize and materialize physically, which &quot;would change the world&quot;.</p>
<h3>IV. Monetary Decentralization and Future Community Design</h3>
<h4>Currency and Unit of Account</h4>
<p>The young generation often views <strong>cryptocurrency as their &quot;native unit of account,&quot;</strong> having to translate back to dollars. Bitcoin, in particular, has become the <strong>benchmark</strong> for returns in the space.</p>
<p>In macro terms, the world is moving away from Western denomination, marked by the decline of US Dollar (USD) dominance in global trade settlements (now under 50%). This shift is not leading to a replacement by the Chinese yuan, but rather to greater <strong>decentralization</strong>. This <strong>&quot;global patchwork economy&quot;</strong> creates more opportunity for an internet-native state to grow aggressively.</p>
<h4>The Concept of the Network School</h4>
<p>Carlson-Wee expressed strong optimism (<strong>&quot;very bullish&quot;</strong>) about the Network School concept. He notes that it is difficult to explain using comparative metaphors (e.g., &quot;imagine you had Stanford but it was just starting&quot;) because it is defining a <strong>&quot;new category&quot;</strong>—the <strong>&quot;secret third thing&quot;</strong>—much like Polychain defined a new category of crypto funds.</p>
<p>If Carlson-Wee were to found a network state, it would be <strong>aesthetically based</strong>. He values the <strong>&quot;vibes&quot;</strong> and would prioritize <strong>editability over luxury</strong>. He suggests that these communities should be built as <strong>&quot;startup communities,&quot;</strong> like a <strong>&quot;pirate ship,&quot;</strong> prioritizing potential over immediate perks.</p></article></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"content":"# Notes - Network State Conference 2025\n*October 21, 2025*\n\n## Forma and the Future of Solana Economic Zones\n\nFarhaj Mayan, co-founder of Forma, presented on the concept and progress of Solana economic zones (SEZs). Forma's core mission is to work with *frontier countries and their governments* to develop these SEZs, which function as physical hubs designed to build economic relations between the cloud (Solana) and nation-states (LAN).\n\n### Forma's Extensive Track Record\n\nIn the two years preceding the conference, Forma's team traveled over 100,000 kilometers and hosted four pop-ups across three continents. Key achievements include:\n\n*   Developing three long-term Solana hubs that actively engage with the local government and ecosystem.\n*   Delivering over $5 million in foreign direct investment (FDI) through virtual events and long-term projects.\n*   Generating over 10 million impressions on X (Twitter) through promotional videos created for these countries, helping to bring them to global attention.\n\n### Case Study: Kazakhstan Partnership\n\nForma highlighted its most recent pop-up in Kazakhstan, calling it the *first ever formal official partnership* between a nation-state and the Solana network state.\n\nEvent Structure and Attendance:\nThe Kazakhstan engagement ran as a 1-day summit followed by a one-week trade mission coordinated directly with the national government. The live-streamed summit hoped to draw over 150,000 viewers. It was attended by over 250 government delegates, including national ministries, the national bank, and the securities commission.\n\nKey Outcomes and Post-Event Impact:\nDuring the event, four Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) were signed. Specifically, an MOU was signed with the Government of Kazakhstan and the Solana Foundation, officially recognizing and launching the Solana Economic Zone (SEZ) as the region's first.\n\nSince the event, significant developments have occurred:\n\n1.  Digital Tenge Launch: Kazakhstan successfully launched its national currency stable coin, the *Digital Tenge*, on Solana.\n2.  Dual Listing Framework: The Astana International Exchange (AIX), which is NASDAQ-powered, signed an MOU with the Solana Foundation, Intabix, and Jupiter to develop a new framework allowing for the dual listing of public companies on Solana. This initiative aims to bring the liquidity of capital markets from the internet to the nation-state.\n3.  Developer Training: A national hackathon was delivered (in conjunction with Intabix), training over 1,000 developers on how to build on Solana.\n4.  Crypto City Announcement: Just 22 days prior to the conference, the President of Kazakhstan announced plans to establish a national crypto reserve and build a crypto city—a designated physical location for bleeding-edge blockchain innovation and payments.\n\n### Forma's Future Direction\n\nForma is moving away from the pop-up model and focusing on settling. The organization is in late-stage discussions with *three countries* (primarily in the Western Hemisphere) to establish long-term SEZs. The goal is to better match Forma's objectives with the host governments' economic development goals.\n\nForma also announced its last pop-up village ever. This event will be held in Georgia from November 15 to 22. It is intended to host 150 members of the Solana community (and is open to all) to deliver a cultural experience and allow participants to beta test living in the country.\n\n\n## Edge City: Incubating the Future of the Network State Movement\n\nTimour Coers introduced Edge City as a society incubator. Edge City's primary mission involves three core activities: hosting *month-long pop-up villages* for those at the frontiers of tech, science, and culture; incubating and accelerating startups, new institutions, and entirely new fields of thought; and ultimately, building the infrastructure for the future of the network state movement.\n\n#### Track Record and Global Vision\n\nIn less than two years, Edge City has achieved significant global reach:\n\n*   Hosted seven pop-ups across four continents.\n*   Over 11,000 people have attended their events.\n*   80 countries have been represented.\n*   They have raised over $1 million in grants for early-stage builders.\n*   The community is multigenerational, with over 150 kids attending. (A fun fact mentioned is that five children were conceived at or because of Edge).\n\nEdge City aims to create a global innovation network rather than replicate Silicon Valley (SF) elsewhere. Their hubs begin as temporary locations to run *interesting and radical experiments* and are intended to become permanent over time, with examples cited in California and Bhutan.\n\n#### Village Structure and Core Principles\n\nThe villages are described as the \"highest leverage months of your year,\" gathering 500 to 1,000 curious, kind, and high agency people in an environment that maintains the dynamism of a city but the social fabric and size of a village. They focus on creating an environment for deep connection, recognizing that people must *care about each other enough* to start a new society together.\n\nEdge City operates under four organizational principles:\n\n1.  Default Healthy: Emphasis on healthy food, time in nature, and daily workouts, ensuring everyone leaves healthier than they arrived.\n2.  Multi-disciplinary: Fostering innovation that emerges from the intersection of different fields.\n3.  Building and Co-creation: Promoting an ethos where everyone ships while at Edge, making the ecosystem \"open source in real life\".\n4.  Multigenerational: Designing an environment where children can thrive, surrounded by top minds.\n\n#### Incubation Success Stories\n\nEdge City serves as the best place for *rapid prototyping*, leading to several successful projects:\n\n*   Constellation: A startup founded by a Stanford Neuroscience PhD, Avery Creger, who ran a trial, collected one of the largest multimodal data sets of its kind, found his lead investor, and built his team all in 30 days.\n*   Vasa Computation: Well-known theorist Mike Johnson found collaborators at Edge, helping unblock his applied research in the field of consciousness.\n*   Decentralized Autonomous Corporations (DAC) Movement: Edge City has supported the DAC movement by helping shift it from theory to practice, organizing a grants program with Vitalik, and hosting a residency with Protocol Labs.\n*   New Physical States: Edge is actively working to help build *Esmeralda*, a frontier tech family-friendly town one hour north of SF in California. They are also engaged with government officials in Bhutan regarding the site of the new Gilfu Mindfulness City project.\n\n#### Upcoming Village and Future Focus\n\nEdge City's next pop-up will be held in Patagonia from October 18th to November 15th of this year. They plan to transform a small town into a village, onboarding the majority of local businesses to crypto payments. The event will feature 16 different residencies (smaller sub-communities) and offer amenities like saunas, cold plunges, and deep workspace.\n\n## Infinita: The Longevity Network State\n\nNiklas Anzinger, founder of Infinita, presented the vision for **Infinita, the longevity network state**. The fundamental goal is to drive **massive biotech acceleration** with the belief that curing aging is possible based on the laws of physics and available science and technology.\n\n#### The Biotech Problem and Call for Acceleration\n\nInfinita's mission is motivated by the historical challenge of premature death resulting from a lack of access to life-saving drugs, citing the example of artist Keith Haring, who died from HIV when treatments were potentially available but restricted by agencies like the FDA. A significant structural problem currently plaguing biotech is that **pharmaceutical R\u0026D returns have collapsed below the cost of capital**. This collapse is occurring despite major advancements like GLP1s and mRNA vaccines, making it *“increasingly less scalable to build a biotech company”*.\n\n#### Physical Hubs and Jurisdictional Innovation\n\nSince drugs cannot be taken online, Infinita has established physical instantiation in the world.\n\n*   **Prospera, Honduras:** The main hub is located in Prospera, on the island of Rotan, Honduras. Prospera is highlighted as having the **best legal system in the world** and specifically allowing for **medical freedom**.\n    *   Infinita has brought *more than 1,500 people* and **over 100 startups** to Prospera.\n    *   They have funneled **more than \\$20 million** to those startups.\n    *   The community lives in the **Duna Tower**, a 14-story building that features a community lab and co-working space with solar punk art.\n    *   The **mini circle gene therapy** is available there, which Brian Johnson traveled to take, as documented in the *Don't Die* Netflix documentary.\n    *   One startup operating in Prospera recently treated **Kim Kardashian and Khloe Kardashian** with their gene therapy.\n    *   Venture capitalist Tim Draper reportedly called the startup pitch competition hosted there the **“highest density of great startups”** he has ever witnessed.\n*   **Montana Expansion:** Infinita has recently expanded to work with innovative jurisdictions, including the state of Montana. Montana is promising for longevity treatments because it extends \"Right to Try\" laws—which allow patients access to unapproved but proven safe drugs—from applying only to terminally ill patients (as is standard elsewhere) **to everyone**.\n\n#### Economic System\n\nThe community utilizes the **Lives Token**, which functions as a stable coin backed payment token and a gateway to the community. The Lives Token is used for payments with *more than 40 different vendors* on Rotan for various items, including food, car rentals, and even mortgage payments. Users can earn benefits by completing tasks and transacting in this economy using the provided wallet and residency card tooling.\n\n#### The Infinite Games\n\nInfinita announced the upcoming **Infinite Games**, a major series of competitions and tournaments aimed at people who want to optimize their health, enjoy competition, and have fun.\n\n*   The games will include a **Rejuvenation Olympics**, where participants measure biomarkers, track health, and take part in competitions.\n*   The national sport of Infinita City, **Electric Knife Fighting (EKF)**, will feature a championship (EKFC). This sport utilizes rubber knives equipped with tasers, similar to fencing.\n*   Other events planned include a **free diving world championship**, poker tournaments, prediction markets tournaments, and cyberpunk paintball.\n*   The Infinite Games are scheduled to take place next year throughout **February and March** on the beautiful island of Rotan, within the Prospera jurisdiction in Honduras.\n\n## Zuitzerland: Building a Permanent Village and Accelerator for Differential Acceleration (d/acc)\n\nIsla Munro-Hochmayr, the founder of Zuitzerland, introduced the project as building a **permanent Swiss village** and an **accelerator for DAK** (differential acceleration) and **open source technology**. The project seeks to create the *best place for people solving humanity's biggest challenges*.\n\n#### Core Motivation: The Future of Humanity and Capital Allocation\n\nThe project is heavily influenced by the essay \"My Techno-Optimism\" by Vitalik, which posits that the next decade is critical for humanity. The central question is whether accelerated technology leads to a future where humanity retains **freedom, agency, and privacy**, or one controlled by centralized companies and wealthy individuals.\n\nZuitzerland’s purpose is to allocate capital at a similar scale toward builders focused on *long-term, decentralized, democratic, differential* ways.\n\n*   **Vision:** The village is intended to be a **shelling point for the future's hundred billion dollar companies**. It promotes a model where purpose is more than profit, but the two are not mutually exclusive, aiming to build entities like the next Ethereum or Uniswap.\n*   **Legitimacy and Capital:** The founders recognize that legitimacy is a powerful social technology. In the existing attention economy, capital is often allocated to things that manipulate attention, but the physical hubs being built are crucial because they create **in-person legitimacy** through **tight social graphs**.\n*   **Investable Model:** Following a challenge from Vitalik to devise an *investable model*, Zuitzerland is developing a **tokenized economy**. This model would be piloted in Switzerland, with the goal of expanding into a transnational network of hubs. The token economy is designed to create value and upside that flows back into the ecosystem, operating like an endowment fund (e.g., Harvard or Stanford) but utilizing an **economic flywheel on a token ecosystem**.\n\n#### Why Switzerland?\n\nSwitzerland was chosen as the pilot location because its cultural and historical framework aligns well with the project's goals:\n\n*   **Governing Philosophy:** If Silicon Valley's motto is \"move fast and break things,\" Switzerland's is \"**move fast and try not to break things**\".\n*   **Decentralized Governance:** Switzerland possesses a **700-year history of decentralized governance**, creating a powerful social and cultural technology aligned with d/acc.\n*   **Talent and Commitment:** The region has strong talent, including ETH, EPFL, the Zurich AI hub, and CryptoVal. Crucially, the Swiss government has committed to building all software as **open source technology** (within security limitations).\n\nZuitzerland is positioning itself as *d/combinator*—a place for ambitious founders who *do not want to sell out*.\n\n#### Progress and Future Plans\n\nThe project has demonstrated proof of concept:\n\n*   **Residency:** In May, Zuitzerland ran its first residency at *Locks*, a ski resort, as a proof of concept for an onchain village.\n*   **Strategic Partnership:** The success of the residency led to a long-term strategic partnership with Locks to develop a pilot that could bring the **entire resort on chain next year**.\n*   **Expansion:** The team is also in discussions with Blockchain Zug and the canton, planning to collaborate with universities and researchers to establish a fully functioning **onchain economy**.\n\n## Fireside Chat: Arthur Hayes and Balaji Srinivasan on Bitcoin, Macro Shifts, and the Code-Based Order\n\nThe fireside chat featured Arthur Hayes (AH) and Balaji Srinivasan (B) discussing global economic trends, longevity, and the shift from traditional systems to decentralized networks.\n\n#### **The \"Get Your Bitcoin and Get Out\" Thesis and Macro Economics**\n\nArthur Hayes elaborated on his quote, \"Get your Bitcoin and get out,\" arguing that global politicians consistently promise spending (e.g., more bombs, free healthcare, jobs) without raising taxes. The resulting funding mechanism is the printing of **\"a fuck ton of money,\"** which increases liquidity for Bitcoin and certain cryptocurrencies.\n\n*   **Systemic Turning Point:** Hayes believes the world is at an **80-year turning point** of massive change. Politicians attempt to limit volatility by printing money until the system \"explodes\".\n*   **Exit Strategy:** The advice is to convert earned fiat into assets like **Bitcoin, gold, or great equities** and \"exit stage left\" to stable jurisdictions such as Singapore or Dubai.\n*   **Reserve Currencies:** B noted that gold appears to be becoming the **reserve currency of states**, while **Bitcoin** is becoming the **reserve currency of the network**. AH confirmed that central banks are buying gold because they understand it as a protector of wealth. The ability of governments to print *infinite fiat* only became common in the 20th century, enabling funding for prolonged wars.\n*   **Debt and the Fed:** AH highlighted concerns about the US macro picture, specifically who will own the accumulating debt. He noted the Federal Reserve (Fed) is performing \"treasury buybacks\" (starting small, a few billion) which looks like the beginning of **yield curve control**. Since 2020, the Fed has refused to let any bond longer than 10 years mature or sell it, meaning there is **no quantitative tightening** on the long end of the yield curve.\n*   **Tariffs and Scarcity:** Tariffs amplify financial strain because they reduce the utility of the dollar by telling trade partners to stop selling things for printed money. AH suggested that US industrial policy, driven by the need to allocate credit to produce necessities like rare earths and chips, stems from the military realization that the US \"can't actually win a war\". B suggested that the US signals strength but the underlying substance is **scarcity**.\n\n#### **Shifting to the Code-Based Order**\n\nThe conversation covered the shift from the traditional \"rules-based order\" to the more reliable **\"code-based order,\"** driven by Bitcoin and smart contracts.\n\n*   **Disrupting Banking:** AH believes the **banking system is \"very ripe to be completely disrupted\"** by DeFi. Compliance, accounting, and cross-border money transfer can be done instantly for the cost of a gas transaction.\n*   **Stable Coins as Licenses:** B proposed that a **stable coin** functions as a *new kind of banking license*, allowing an entire financial UX (like Wells Fargo or Chase) to be built on a stable coin backend. Traditional banks' high valuations and huge employment numbers (e.g., 315,000 at JPMC) are sustained because they function as *arms of the government* and hold a crucial **government license**. Stable coins provide an **unlocked network** defense against the locked network of traditional banks.\n*   **Identity and Sovereignty:** B suggested that **denaturalization** (stripping citizenship) is the new debanking. Crypto offers a defense through Bitcoin (banking) and ENS/crypto identities (identity). AH observed that people have an emotional attachment to their birthplace identity (\"lottery ticket\"), but that choosing a crypto tribe (ETH, Solana, Bitcoin) is a **stronger bond** based on conscious choice and signing a \"social smart contract\".\n\n#### **Longevity and Stem Cell Investment**\n\nHayes is personally interested and involved in **longevity**.\n\n*   **Veritas Clinic:** Two years prior, AH began researching stem cells and met Julian, the CEO of **Veritas** (a clinic near Thailand), in which he is now an investor and board member.\n*   **Aim:** Hayes aims to \"feel like I'm 30 for the rest of my life\". The goal is to further research and commercialize stem cell treatments, hoping to lower prices over time.\n*   **Medical Bravery:** B praised AH's willingness to take the personal health risk, calling it **\"medical bravery,\"** which is necessary to push for \"an ampic for longevity\".\n\n#### **Balaji's Vision: The Decentralized Country**\n\nBalaji shared his core ambition, stating that while others focus on Mars or AGI, he wants to **start a new country**.\n\n*   **Islands Separated by Internet:** B envisions a **decentralized country** replacing \"islands separated by ocean\" (like Indonesia) with **islands separated by internet**.\n*   **Coordination and Peace:** Coordination across distance is possible via teleresence, remote work, and drones. B believes this endeavor can be accomplished **nonviolently**, citing the independence of India and Singapore.\n*   **No Army:** The network state, backed by Bitcoin, would require \"no army\".\n\n## **Binance's Global Vision and Strategy (Fireside with Richard Teng)**\n\nThe CEO of Binance, Richard Teng, discussed the company's priorities, its role in financial inclusion, and the geopolitical landscape of crypto regulation. Teng joined Binance in 2021.\n\n#### Company Scale and Focus\n\nBinance’s priority is always centered on its **users**, maintaining their trust and confidence. The company is aiming for a major milestone of **1 billion users** globally, building upon its current base of almost 300 million users.\n\nKey organizational activities include:\n\n*   Rolling out new products, such as the enhanced **Web3 wallet (Binance Alpha)**.\n*   Working with institutions (citing a partnership with Franklin Templeton) and ecosystem partners like stable coin issuers.\n*   Being supportive of *all innovation* and collaborating globally with governments, institutions, and communities through events like hackathons.\n\n#### The Mission of Financial Inclusion\n\nBinance is currently the **most regulated exchange globally**, operating in about 22 different jurisdictions. The core mission, set by the founders, is to support the **freedom of money**.\n\nThis mission is crucial because Binance has significant traction in the developing world (the Global South, including Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East).\n\n*   Teng highlighted that **1.4 billion people** globally remain *unbanked*, lacking access to basic banking or payment systems.\n*   Traditional finance has failed to solve this problem over the last 30 years.\n*   Blockchain and crypto provide the **only mode of payment** for many in these regions.\n*   Cross-border remittances are **instantaneous** and cost a fraction of traditional methods, which can take two days.\n*   Crypto, including stable coins and Bitcoin, is a critical **store of wealth** for those experiencing hyperinflationary situations where their fiat currency depreciates sharply.\n\n#### Superiority of Internet Capital Markets\n\nBinance is focused on the potential shift toward *Internet capital markets* becoming the largest in the world. Teng affirmed that the **trajectory is tremendous and strong** for this to happen.\n\nThe crypto system is deemed superior to traditional finance because:\n\n*   It provides **atomic settlement** (immediate clearing), eliminating clearing and settlement risks associated with traditional T+2 settlement.\n*   It offers **global liquidity** that is accessible 24/7 from anywhere, unlike traditional centralized marketplaces. This access provides users with the best execution and lower slippage.\n*   It eliminates many *middle and back office functions* of banks, such as reconciliation, which become unnecessary with blockchain technology.\n\n#### Geopolitics and Regulatory Agility\n\nThe regulatory environment significantly impacts capital flow globally, as demonstrated by the US shift toward being more pro-crypto, which compels other governments to pay attention to attract foreign direct investment and talent.\n\nIn terms of effective execution, Singapore and Middle Eastern countries like *Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Bahrain* are executing well.\n\nA key advantage noted is that **smaller countries** are often **more crypto friendly** because they are *more nimble and agile* than large countries burdened by tedious regulatory processes involving multiple agencies. These small states are essentially **startup countries**.\n\n*   Smaller states are willing to **experiment** because failure is contained, while success brings \"huge impact in terms of economic windfall\".\n*   Binance is actively helping institutions and countries set up **strategic asset reserves** in crypto (citing Bhutan and Kazakhstan as examples).\n*   Countries with sovereignty (the ~200 UN-listed nations, plus special economic zones) can be approached to facilitate deals that modify laws in exchange for capital investment.\n\n## Bruno Macaes on Geopolitics, Technology, and the \"God Mode\" of World Building\n\nBruno Macaes presented the core ideas of his 2025 book, ***World Builders***, focusing on how geopolitical power is fundamentally changing through technology.\n\n#### The True Nature of Geopolitical Power\n\nMacaes argues that when analyzing geopolitics, one must shift perspective from the *agent* (or player) to the **programmer**. The world is far more *constructed* and **virtual** than commonly perceived.\n\n*   **Definition of Power:** **Geopolitical power is essentially the power to build a world** or a virtual landscape that others are compelled to inhabit and operate within.\n*   **Implicit Deception:** Builders possess a powerful advantage if those operating within the system believe it is the *natural* or *inevitable* world, rather than a built one.\n*   **The \"God Mode\" Concept:** Geopolitical power is defined as the ability to enter the **control panel of the global system** and change its variables.\n    *   *Political power* is defined as playing the game.\n    *   ***God mode*** is defined as changing the variables of the game state via the control panel.\n*   **Real-World Example:** The blocking of **\\$300 billion in Russian central bank reserves** during the war in Ukraine demonstrated this \"god mode,\" as the reserves existed merely as computer entries in Frankfurt or the New York Fed.\n\n#### Technology and the Network State\n\nMacaes stressed that technology builders must recognize that they are creating the *framework* within which human life and political life operate, not just \"some gadgets\".\n\n*   **Coding the Game:** The concept of the network state represents rising to the programmer's perspective—where **a superpower codes the game, and a normal power plays the game**.\n*   **Fusion of Systems:** Macaes asserts that **geopolitics and technology are synonyms**. The political system and the technological system operate in remarkably similar ways, noting the presence of key tech figures during events like Donald Trump's inauguration.\n*   **Power Inside the Network:** Macaes views established powers (like the United States or China) as existing network states, but ones **controlled from outside the network**. Balaji's network state concept aims to move power *inside* the network, promoting a structure that is decentralized and democratic.\n*   **Origin of Ideas:** The core ideas presented originated during a discussion Macaes had with Balaji while walking in Singapore approximately a year prior to the conference.\n\n## **Multicurrency Mercantilism and the Shifting Global Monetary Order**\n\nKathleen Tyson presented on the concept of **Multicurrency Mercantilism**. She noted that the idea, which was controversial when launched two years ago, is now considered *mainstream*. The fundamental transition in the global monetary order is recognized as real. The alternative to the dollar is defined not as a single replacement, but as **\"the dollar and all other currencies\"**.\n\n#### **The Decline of Dollar Dominance and Geopolitical Accelerants**\n\nWhile monetary transition can be gradual and stable, **war accelerates the transition**. Current geopolitical turmoil, including the war in Ukraine and the conflicts in Gaza and attacks on neighboring countries like Iran, Syria, Yemen, and Lebanon, is escalating wider war risks. These wider wars are simultaneously **escalating US deficits**, prompting people to flee from funding treasury markets.\n\nThe dollar has demonstrated underperformance, having dropped **14% against other currencies** and **45% in gold terms** over the past year.\n\n#### **The Evolving Multipolar World**\n\nTyson argues that China is **not going to be the next hegemon**. China is currently the *leading trade partner* of over 150 states but actively treats its partners as sovereign. It is comfortable allowing trade to occur in renminbi, dollar, euro, or the partner's own currency.\n\nWhile countries in the United States and Europe perceive *fragmentation* because they are losing control, the other 7 billion people on the planet are experiencing **unification, pacification, and collaboration**. This process is accelerating development because these nations no longer require the West for capital, management, or education.\n\nThe **Angel Paradox** (the idea that sanctions harm the sanctioner as much as the sanctioned) has played out:\n\n*   Sanctions on Russia have resulted in Russia experiencing significant growth, making it the **fourth largest economy on the planet**.\n*   Meanwhile, Europe is rapidly *de-industrializing* due to energy costs that have doubled or trebled.\n\n#### **Technology, Reserves, and Stability Risks**\n\n**Technology** is advancing rapidly, evidenced by new innovations like Deep Seek and a new **salt battery out of China** that can last up to 25 years while costing only 5-10% of previous batteries. China is now *completely technologically independent* of Western dependencies and is sharing its technology globally.\n\n**Gold** is seeing record prices, trading at **$3,880 an ounce**, with silver at $47. To bypass expropriation risks associated with London and New York, China announced it will use Hong Kong to **vault official gold reserves** purchased on the Shanghai gold exchange.\n\nRegarding **debt**, private sector debt peaked in 2024 and is being squeezed out, which is *bad for growth*. However, public sector debt is still expanding at an accelerating rate. Instability is a serious risk, leading many countries to collaborate to preserve **resiliency**.\n\nThe capability exists for central banks to be multicurrency; the speaker affirmed they built a system operating in **eight currencies across 12 depositories in real time**. Central banks are expected to adopt this choice to spread risks and enhance systemic resiliency and liquidity.\n\nFinally, the presentation concluded with a call for action: \"Those who love peace need to learn to organize as effectively as those who love war\".\n\n## Avik Roy on Expert Failure and Reforming Institutions via Exit\n\nAvik Roy’s presentation focused on analyzing the widespread **failure of experts** as the root cause of the **greatest public policy failures of the 21st century**. Roy draws on his background as a biotech investor, policy advisor, and opinion editor to analyze this pattern.\n\n#### The Repeatable Pattern of Expert Failure\n\nMajor public policy disasters driven by expert consensus include:\n*   The 2003 invasion of Iraq, fueled by intelligence experts convinced of WMDs.\n*   The 2008 financial crisis, linked to macro experts like Alan Greenspan who believed the housing bubble was not a \"big deal\".\n*   The 2020 **shutdown of society**, which caused **irreversible harm** to children due to school closures in the U.S..\n\nThis failure follows a **repeatable pattern**:\n1.  An expert cites an **actually true fact** (e.g., coronaviruses are dangerous).\n2.  A **sweeping prescription** is made based on that fact (e.g., shut down society to achieve zero transmission).\n3.  Experts then gather their peers to **kick out dissenters** from advisory boards and the media, creating an illusion of **unanimity among the credentialed**.\n4.  Policymakers act on this false consensus, leading to policies that ultimately **\"doesn't work out\"**.\n\nRoy notes this pattern also applies to less massive failures, such as dietary experts recommending 11 servings of carbs daily, or pain experts pushing opioids.\n\n#### Necessary Reforms for Expert Success\n\nTo reverse this pattern, Roy argues for structural changes that foster success:\n*   **Legitimate Dissent:** There must always be a role for dissenters in any expert community to **test ideas**.\n*   **Decentralized Policy Architecture:** New societies need a system where people can **experiment with different sets of rules** and try various approaches to build innovative systems.\n*   **Diversity of AI Models:** Going forward, a diversity of AI models is essential to avoid the information control previously seen when Google and Wikipedia dominated access to information.\n*   **Meritocracy:** This prevents the compounding error where policymakers turn to the *same experts* who created a mess to fix it.\n\nRoy suggests that building new institutions is often easier than reforming existing ones, referencing Elon Musk's sentiment that it is **\"easier to go to Mars than it is to reduce the federal budget\"**.\n\n#### Network States and the Expert Diaspora\n\n**Network states** can take advantage of the **expert diaspora** leaving legacy societies to create better systems and economies. Specific areas for innovation include:\n\n*   **Digital Assets:** Since crypto **will flow where it's treated best**, network states can implement better rules, forcing jurisdictions like the U.S. to respond.\n*   **Energy:** Network states can implement models for **abundant energy** creation using a **lower carbon way**, challenging the dogma of simply using less energy.\n*   **Customized AI:** AI models should be **tailored to the unique needs** and idiosyncrasies of network states.\n*   **Healthcare Reimaginaton:** This is a key area for reform beyond the FDA. Network states can build new entities that allow for a **more fluid way to take advantage of the workforce** by changing credentialing for MDs and nurses in an AI-powered world. They can also redesign **where** healthcare is delivered, challenging the multi-trillion dollar hospital industry.\n\nExperts who leave legacy institutions can **build new entities and paradigms** in a network state setting, allowing everyone to benefit.\n\n## Parag Khanna on the Age of Digital Nomads and the Passportal\n\nParag Khanna, the founder of the geospatial data science company **Alpha Geo**, discussed the physics of human geography and the intensifying global *war for talent*. Khanna, who has traveled to **more than 150 countries**, operates on the modified axiom that one should only trust what they *experience firsthand*.\n\n#### The Physics of Human Mobility\n\nKhanna’s research, detailed in his book *Move*, examines what happens when the \"unstoppable force\" of **migration** meets the \"immovable object\" of **borders**. Currently, all drivers of human migration—including geopolitical turmoil, labor shortages, economic/technological displacement, and climate change—are \"in overdrive\".\n\n*   **Global Talent Recruitment:** Despite narratives of nationalism and xenophobia, governments are engaged in an intense **war for talent**. The past decade has seen an *explosion* in programs like RBI, CBI, Golden Visas (e.g., the UAE Golden Visa, which Khanna helped develop) and **digital nomad programs**.\n*   **Relocation Trends:** An estimated **2.6 million people** are expected to relocate this year, of which about **150,000 are millionaires**. This is creating a *new geography of wealth* as high net worth individuals move away from older centers. Alpha Geo, in partnership with Henley and Partners, is releasing a **Global Investment Risk and Resilience Index** to rank destinations based on stability and economic factors.\n*   **The American Diaspora:** The US now has a sizable diaspora of about **7 million people** abroad. Europe is actively recruiting US-based talent, and the credo of these moving Americans is often described as *liquidity, mobility, and optionality*.\n*   **Scale of Movement:** There are already **over 300 million people** living outside their country of origin (the highest number ever), a number expected to surge.\n\n#### Introducing the Passportal\n\nKhanna noted that crossing borders remains the **most overbureaucratized dimension of globalization**. To solve this, he proposed the **Passportal**, a foundational platform for identity and mobility.\n\n*   **Core Principle:** The Passportal is built on the principle that **your identity belongs to you**.\n*   **Function and Technology:** It is envisioned as *identity as a service meets mobility as a service*. Its purpose is to function as the instrument for becoming a **sovereign individual on the internet**. It will assemble key components of societal identity into a **secure blockchain ID wallet**. The platform will utilize **ZK (Zero-Knowledge) knowledge protocols** for collecting credentials and attestations.\n*   **Economic Impact:** The Passportal is designed to *most effectively match supply and demand for labor* globally, a process that could potentially boost GDP by **25%**.\n*   **Monetization and Benefits:** The platform will launch next year with pilot countries.\n    *   **Individuals** will pay a base user fee.\n    *   **Governments** can massively streamline application vetting, issue e-visas, and cut billions spent on consular services.\n    *   **Corporates** can use an **AI matchmaking system** to find desired workers.\n*   **Platform Potential:** The Passportal is a foundational platform that can support numerous added services, including insurance, relocation, healthcare, remittances, and skills training.\n\n## **The End of Nation States: A New Era of Neo-Medievalism**\n\n### Overview and Thesis\n\nThis presentation argues that the world is being ushered into a new era of **neo-medievalism** due to technological forces that are **weakening the established power of nation states**. The central idea posits that the rise and fall of political structures are determined by which technologies allow for easy control and taxation.\n\n### Historical Drivers: Fragmentation and Consolidation\n\n#### The Fragmentation of the Middle Ages\n\nOne of the key reasons why Europe was fragmented during the Middle Ages was the nature of **farming**, which generated wealth across *surfaces* (land) that were **very hard to monitor**. This difficulty in centralized monitoring allowed local lords to hold considerable power. Simultaneously, the Church maintained a **monopoly on information and thought**.\n\n#### Technological Drivers in the Rise of Nation States\n\nOver subsequent centuries, this fragmented system disappeared, replaced by nation states. The following technologies facilitated the rise of powerful, central states:\n\n*   **Information Control:** The **printing press** generated a massive volume of content, which helped break the Church's control (or \"chokehold\") on information.\n*   **Agricultural and Urban Shifts:** The **agricultural revolution** resulted in the breeding of better horses and the creation of new inventions (like the horseshoe, horse collar, and heavy plow), leading to a **massive increase in crop yields and population**. The increased population migrated to **cities**, which are *points* rather than surfaces, making them **much easier to control and tax**.\n*   **Transportation and Choke Points:** **Ocean fairing ships** enabled new empires that traded through **Atlantic ports**, which were easily controlled and taxed as choke points. Later, **railroads and roads** were also easy for nation states to control because they are natural monopolies built upon physical networks.\n*   **Financial and Military Power:** Improvements in mining technology increased the silver supply by four to five times, with those controlling **mines** (points) making immense wealth (e.g., the Habsburgs had a near-monopoly on silver). The need for financiers (like the Fuggers or Medici) and the escalation of military technology (cannons strengthening against fortresses, and vice versa) meant that **only the richest states could afford big armies** to overwhelm smaller ones.\n*   **Energy Localization:** Energy shifted from distributed, sun-based sources in medieval times (water, wind, wood, human food, animals) to sources like **coal and oil** in the 19th and 20th centuries, which were **localized in geography** and thus much easier to control.\n*   **Centralized Media:** Technologies like **TV stations and radio stations** became easier to control, reinforcing state power.\n\n### The Weakening of Nation States\n\nThe same technological forces that once strengthened nation states are now **making them weaker**. This trend is leading the world toward a new system of *neo-medievalism*:\n\n*   **Decentralized Connectivity:** The **internet** can be beamed from anywhere.\n*   **Global Communication:** **English is becoming the global language**.\n*   **Financial Freedom:** The emergence of **cryptocurrencies**.\n*   **Energy Decentralization:** A shift back to **solar** as a source of energy.\n*   **Geographic Independence:** **Remote work** allows individuals to earn money while being **uprooted from geography**.\n\nThese modern forces reverse the historical trends, diminishing the control once held by centralized nation states.\n\n## Fireside with Animoca's Yat Siu: Funding Network States and Digital Ownership\n\n### I. Conference Context and Animoca's Structure\n\nThe discussion took place at the Network State Conference 2025, which Balaji characterized as \"much more **zen**\" and focused on \"deeper talks,\" place at the Network State Conference 2025, which Balaji characterized as \"much more **zen**\" and focused on \"deeper talks,\" contrasting it with the \"blingfest\" of the Token conference.\n\nYat Siu provided an overview of **Animoca**, describing it as a \"gigantic digital conglomerate\". Animoca is one of the largest investors in the areas of **crypto, blockchain, and gaming**, holding over **628 portfolio companies**.\n\nCrucially, Animoca is **not a fund**; it operates using *prop capital* (proprietary capital). While traditional tech giants (like Google or Apple) focus on extraction, Animoca’s model dictates that **\"every profit that we make goes back into the ecosystem to develop it out more,\"** positioning it almost like an ecosystem fund or a network structure similar to the South Korean *chaebols*. Animoca thinks about its operations in terms of building an economy and using **GDP** as a metric.\n\n### II. Blockchain, Governance, and Self-Organization\n\nThe rise of crypto has fostered a deep, common culture across corporate boundaries, rooted in shared values like **decentralization** and **self-sovereign keys**.\n\nBlockchain is seen as providing a **scaling form of self-organization** and a reliable **enforcement mechanism** for society. Everyone involved in crypto has essentially **consented to the laws of crypto** and the specific chain they use, creating a chosen jurisdiction.\n\nA monumental achievement demonstrating this self-organization was the **Ethereum transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake (The Merge)**. Balaji was \"stunned\" that this highly complex engineering feat occurred **\"seamlessly,\"** defeating typical intuitions about how both software and human organization are supposed to work.\n\nThe underlying philosophy is that human organization, while driven by self-interest, ultimately aims to benefit most of society, which Balaji terms **\"win and help win,\"** representing crypto at its best.\n\n### III. Gaming, Ownership, and Virtual Economies\n\nThe **gaming industry** is massive, engaging **3.4 billion people** regularly. The panelists noted the historical significance of gaming: the entire **GPU industry**, essential for Bitcoin mining and today's AI technology, arose from the \"whimsical experience\" of wanting better graphics for games.\n\n**Key Concepts in Gaming as Network Societies:**\n\n*   **Scale:** Games like **Roblox** (380 million users) and **Minecraft** (160–180 million users) are already massive network societies.\n*   **User-Generated Content (UGC):** The top two games (Roblox and Minecraft) rely on UGC and the ability for users to run their own servers and mod communities.\n*   **Ownership:** The core differentiator is **ownership**—the idea that players have a stake or a sense of ownership in the assets, which transcends mere content consumption.\n*   **Macroeconomic Experiments:** Games like **Second Life** and **Eve Online** have persisted for almost 20 years because they operate like \"island states\" with their own economies, communities, and ownership structures. Virtual economies have served as the first experimental subjects for macroeconomics, allowing simulations of entire economies.\n\n**The Problem of Inflation:** Gaming companies often act as the **\"worst in QE\"** (Quantitative Easing) by constantly inflating their internal economy. This inflation causes games to \"die\" because new, casual gamers cannot afford the inflated assets, preventing the game from expanding beyond its core community. This economic challenge mirrors real-world systems, such as **airline miles**, which operate as a high-margin virtual currency business that in some ways subsidizes the physical airline operation.\n\n### IV. Digital Assets and Identity\n\nBalaji suggested that the Web3 overlap might be better served by **gamifying work** rather than *workifying games*. Yat Siu confirmed that many Asian gamers want to own their assets.\n\n**Tokenization** is a key mechanism that opens up the market structure. Tokenizing gaming assets is viewed as a form of **RWA (Real World Asset) tokenization**, even though it is digital-to-digital.\n\n**Digital Identity** is deemed critical:\n*   **ENS** (Ethereum Name Service) and **SNS IDs** are seen as portable NFTs that are ready for prime time.\n*   Digital IDs allow users to **export their reputation** (e.g., Uber star ratings) between different platforms and ecosystems, unlocking reputation that is currently \"locked in Apple, it's locked in Facebook, it's locked in Steam\".\n\n### V. Funding the Future\n\nYat Siu affirmed that Animoca is actively looking at investments in startup societies and network states. He stated that **\"everything we do... is all about funding network states and network societies and making them grow,\"** as they view this as the future.\n\n## Fireside with Jacqueline Poh, CEO of Singapore's JTC: Industrial Policy and Strategic Growth\n\n### I. JTC's Role and Scope\n\n**## Fireside with Jacqueline Poh, CEO of Singapore's JTC: Industrial Policy and Strategic Growth\n\n### I. JTC's Role and Scope\n\n**JTC (Jurong Town Corporation)** is Singapore's **largest industrial landlord for business**. It manages approximately **$40 billion** in assets under management (AUM). JTC effectively manages the **real estate piece of Singapore's industrial policy**.\n\nJTC is responsible for creating and managing extensive industrial and mixed-use districts, including:\n*   ***one-north:*** A mixed-use district home to companies like Grab and Razer, and the location of **Launchpad**, Singapore's largest startup ecosystem with over **700 startups**.\n*   The **Punggol Digital District**.\n*   **Jurong Island:** Where a massive data center park is being constructed.\n*   Facilities dedicated to **biomed**, medtech, and **wafer fab parks**.\n*   The electronics and semiconductors sector makes up **7% of Singapore's GDP**.\n\n### II. Economic Strategy and Governance\n\nSingapore, a relatively young nation celebrating its 60th birthday in 2025, is currently undergoing a significant economic strategy review. The government is questioning whether solely relying on **MNC-led growth** is sustainable in a more fragmented and deglobalized world. The main aim is to build and **headquarter globally leading companies in Singapore** to provide good jobs and benefit from the country's innovation ecosystem.\n\nKey attributes of Singapore's governance supporting this strategy include:\n*   **Agility:** The government is highly **\"joined up\" and linked together**, which enables it to provide a strong proposition.\n*   **Pro-Business Environment:** Companies can be **registered in about a day or so** (sometimes while the founder is in transit at Changi Airport).\n*   **Technology:** The digital identity app, ***SingPass***, is cited as a very functional government technology product.\n*   **Long-Term Planning:** Singapore has a roughly **30-year head start on industrial policy** compared to other countries that only recently adopted it.\n\n### III. Attracting Global Talent\n\nSingapore views **global tech talent as a competitive advantage**. Initiatives specifically created to draw in founders and capital include:\n\n*   **Tech Pass and One Pass:** Balaji was the first recipient of the **Tech Pass**. This scheme was later expanded into the **One Pass**, which is a **five-year visa with no residency requirements**.\n*   **Spousal Employment:** The One Pass allows individuals who are founders, VCs, or capital holders to bring their spouses, and the spouses are permitted to work on the same visa.\n\n### IV. Economic Pillars and Conscious Management\n\nSingapore maintains a complex and diverse economy:\n\n*   **Manufacturing** accounts for **20% of Singapore's GDP**. This includes high-value, high-tech manufacturing, such as **semiconductors, bio-pharmaceuticals, and medical devices**, often utilizing high robotics and digital twins.\n*   **Finance** is only **15% of GDP**, despite Singapore being one of the world's top five financial hubs.\n\nThe government consciously manages the economic ecosystem, leaning **against the natural market tendency** for the high salaries in finance to draw away all top engineers and talent. This commitment to manufacturing is sustained because the government believes it is important for **resilience and diversity**.\n\nJTC focuses on attracting companies in key tech areas:\n*   **AI:** Singapore produces **100 AI PhDs a year**. AI is expected to transform manufacturing, logistics, and port/airport operations. The government is increasingly using **AI** for competitive analysis and consciously managed processes.\n*   **Autonomous Vehicles (AVs):** Singapore is undertaking a **\"big push\" on AV deployments**.\n*   **Biotech and Medtech**.\n\n### V. The Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ)\n\nTo overcome limitations in land and manpower, Singapore partnered with Malaysia to develop the **Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ)**.\n\n*   **Connectivity:** The border between Johor and Singapore is the **world's busiest land crossing**. A **Rapid Transit System (RTS) train** will soon connect the two, carrying approximately **10,000 people an hour** in 5–10 minutes. JTC is developing the Singapore side, the ***Woodlands Gateway***.\n*   **Scope and Resources:** The zone covers most of Southern Johor, an area many times the size of Singapore. This arrangement is **complementary**: Singapore provides **trust capital, the financial center, innovation, and top universities**; Malaysia provides **manpower and land**.\n*   **Goals:** The partnership is committed to over **50 projects** to attract companies that would not have considered either country alone. The goal is to create at least **20,000 jobs in Johor**.\n\n## A Network of States: Operationalizing the Network State via Network Cities\n\n### I. The Core Problem with Network States\n\nThe presentation addresses the fundamental challenge facing the **network state** concept as originally conceived: the need for **public goods** and **scale**.\n\n*   **Public Goods:** A dispersed human network cannot easily provide essential services like **infrastructure** or **physical security/defense**; these are typically provided by host countries.\n*   **Scale:** A traditional state needs **scale** for crucial elements like **investment**, **trade**, and attracting **skilled professionals** in a globalized economy.\n\n### II. The Solution: Network Cities (A Network of Hong Kongs)\n\nThe proposed solution is the concept of **Network Cities**. These cities are envisioned as a **global network of semi-autonomous communities** or **entrepôts** that coordinate via the internet.\n\n*   **Model:** The concept is inspired by **pre-2019 Hong Kong**. Hong Kong successfully operated under a *one country, two systems* arrangement, giving it its **own laws** and **own currency**—it was **autonomous but not independent**.\n*   **Scale:** If enough cities join, this single network state would encompass over **100 million people**, creating an **incredibly powerful network state** globally.\n*   **Ecosystem:** This large network state would create the space for the **other human networks** (the communities originally envisioned by Balaji) to exist inside it.\n\n### III. The Symbiotic Relationship with Host Countries\n\nThe relationship between the **Network City** and the **host country** is designed to be **symbiotic** (a \"win-win situation\").\n\n| Entity | Role/Incentive | Support |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Host Country** | Provides **security** and **national defense**. The host is incentivized because the city routes massive **trade and investment** to them. | Examples: Every country—including Indonesia, Brazil, Nigeria, and the EU—could host one (like Macau is hosted by China). |\n| **Network City** | Provides its own internal **public goods and infrastructure**. | The city builds its **own trains, water systems, sewage systems, and telecom**. |\n\nThe network state in this symbiotic model is **not seen as parasitical** but rather mutually beneficial.\n\n### IV. Mobility and Network Enforcement\n\n#### Free Movement\nA critical feature is the **free movement of people, capital, and everything like that between** the Network Cities.\n\n*   **Internal Mobility:** Residents of one Network City would be **free to move automatically** to any of the other cities around the world (e.g., in Brazil, Europe, or anywhere else).\n*   **Restricted Mobility:** Movement (population mobility) would be **restricted between the city and the mainland** of the host country.\n\n#### Network Punishment\nTo mitigate the risk of a host country absorbing and conquering its Network City (as China did to Hong Kong in 2019):\n\n*   The **large global network of entrepôts** would coordinate to **reroute trade and finance** around the offending country.\n*   This network punishment would cause the host country to **lose out on investment and trade** brought by the city.\n*   **Historical Precedent:** This defense mechanism is modeled after the **Hanseatic League** (1200s–1400s), a league of German merchants who used their network power to famously **punish the city of Bruge** for blocking their trade.\n\n### V. Operationalizing Finance and Governance\n\nA **large holding company** could be established, potentially **headquartered in Singapore** or operating **on the blockchain**, to coordinate **investment and trade finance** between all the Network Cities.\n\nThe creation of the Network of Cities is seen as a combination of the ideas of **network states** and **charter cities**, solving all the \"thorny questions\" of network state operation simultaneously. It opens the possibility for a **new kind of state** to coexist peacefully with existing traditional states in the age of the internet.\n\n## El Salvador: From Homicide Capital to Bitcoin Country\n\n### I. National Rebrand and Economic Strategy\n\nStacy Herbert, the **Director of the National Bitcoin Office of El Salvador**, highlights the country's transformation as **\"one of the greatest rebrands in history\"**. El Salvador went from being known as the **homicide capital of the world** to being recognized globally as **Bitcoin country**. The shift in public perception is described as \" known as the **homicide capital of the world** to being recognized globally as **Bitcoin country**. The shift in public perception is described as \"crazy\".\n\nThe country's economic focus is on **building capital markets on Bitcoin**. This strategy is based on the recognition that a country cannot become a global economic powerhouse without **capital**. El Salvador views Bitcoin as providing a **competitive advantage**. Despite initial **\"blowback from the global powers\"** when Bitcoin was first adopted as legal tender, President Bukele maintained this vision.\n\n### II. Attracting Builders and Global Talent\n\nEl Salvador is actively working to attract **global digital nomads and tech startups** through several initiatives:\n\n*   **Tax Incentives:** The country is offering **0% tax for industries** that establish themselves there.\n*   **Government Responsiveness:** The government is described as **\"very responsive, fast acting\"** and able to quickly address the needs of entrepreneurs.\n*   **Immigration:** El Salvador is introducing **easy pathways to citizenship**. Tourists can easily visit and stay, as the standard tourist visa allows one to stay for **180 days**.\n\n### III. Governance Model and Optimism\n\nThe presentation emphasizes two key aspects of the country's governance:\n\n*   **Security Model:** The **\"Boulli model on security has swept Latin America,\"** suggesting that its disciplined approach is inspiring other countries.\n*   **Regulatory Framework:** El Salvador has a **trailblazing pioneering brand and reputation**. For instance, the **regulatory framework for AI is \"super streamlined,\"** with a simple law accompanied by regulations that are **just 13 pages** long. This streamlined technological framework is explicitly noted as **inspiring other countries**.\n\nFor builders and those interested in network states, El Salvador offers a **huge sense of optimism**. This environment, where people are generally happy and building, contrasts sharply with places where people may feel depressed or that things are getting worse. The Director encourages people to abide by the phrase **\"don't trust, verify\"** and to **come and visit El Salvador and build there** for themselves.\n\n## Expo City Dubai: Pioneering a City Operating System and Open Platform\n\n### I. Expo City Overview and Special Economic Zone Status\n\n**Rashid Mohammed, the CTO of Expo City Dubai**, introduced the project, noting that the site previously hosted **Expo 2020**, which attracted over **24 million visits**. The infrastructure was purpose-built, and approximately **80% was retained** when the site was converted into Expo City Dubai.\n\nExpo City Dubai is an **ambitious city** with a strategy aimed at changing the way cities live and move forward. A key feature is that it is the **newest created free zone in Dubai**, making it a **special economic zone within the UAE**. This status grants the city the ability to change or set its own laws.\n\n### II. The Open Platform for Innovation\n\nExpo City functions as an **open platform for companies to come and test** innovations. It is designed to be an ecosystem that supports startups and innovative companies that serve a city.\n\n*   The city comprises a **huge cluster of 163 buildings**.\n*   Startups can replicate and test technologies within the city.\n\n### III. The Aspiration for a City Operating System (City OS)\n\nRashid Mohammed emphasized that the **logical element** (the operational stack) of city management and buildings is **outdated**. Expo City aspires to change this by creating a fundamental new system for city operations.\n\nThe goal is to develop a **City Operating System (OS)**. This OS would be:\n*   **Open-source**.\n*   **Not locked**.\n*   **Hardware-agnostic**, supporting all protocols.\n\nThis open OS would allow pure software startups with ideas (e.g., facial recognition, power recognition) that are connected to an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system to easily **deploy** their innovations, even if they do not own the hardware.\n\n### IV. Focus on Human-Centric Services and Lifestyle 3.0\n\nThe underlying technological overhaul is necessary because existing management stacks are built for office workers, **not for the people who run the city on the ground**.\n\nThe CTO stated that, in the coming years, the most expensive piece will be the **physical person moving from point A to point B** to perform a task or move equipment. The technical infrastructure needs a **granular level revamp** that has never been done before.\n\nExpo City aspires to transition to a **human-centric, intuitive service**. The project seeks to define **lifestyle 3.0** in a city, contemplating whether this future is still an app or if the service becomes intuitive, requiring no app at all. Expo City is seeking collaboration, potentially from network schoolers, to help build this City OS.\n\n## Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM): A Pioneering, Agile Financial Regulator\n\n### I. Overview and Founding Context\n\n**Wai Lum Kwok** presented on the role and journey of the **Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM)**, the international financial center of Abu Dhabi.\n\n*   **Establishment:** ADGM was set up in **October 2015**.\n*   **Legal Framework:** It operates under **English common law**.\n*   **Mission:** ADGM was established to support Abu Dhabi's **economic diversification strategy**.\n*   **Starting from Scratch:** When ADGM began in 2015, the regulator had the opportunity to **start from scratch**, meaning they had **no legacy issues** and could build regulations by importing best practices from around the world.\n\nThe regulator noted that, unlike some equivalent bodies, it does *not* fulfill a central banking role.\n\n### II. Pioneering Crypto Regulation\n\nADGM recognized early on that the future of financial services would be **technology-enabled**. ADGM was one of the **earliest regulators globally to regulate the crypto space**, issuing its framework in **June 2018**.\n\n*   **Addressing Risk:** At the time, the global conversation was focused heavily on money laundering and financial crime. ADGM benchmarked its efforts against the New York Department of Financial Services and Japanese regulators.\n*   **Institutional Approach:** Institutional investors indicated they would only enter the space if all risks were addressed.\n*   **Regulatory Framework:** ADGM's framework **extends traditional financial regulations to carve in crypto assets** by treating them as **\"just another asset class\"**.\n*   **Ecosystem Growth:** Today, ADGM hosts a young ecosystem that includes broker-dealers, exchanges, custodians, stablecoin issuance, and prime brokers.\n*   **Sovereign Support:** The Abu Dhabi government's **sovereign wealth funds** played a role by **investing in key foundational players** to establish the base layer of the crypto ecosystem. This includes dipping their toes into **mining**, which helps create **risk capital for borrowing and lending**.\n\n### III. Regulatory Innovation and Agility\n\nADGM employs three pillars in its development, with the first being **anticipating the future** and remaining **agile**.\n\n*   **Yield-Bearing Stablecoins:** ADGM **deliberately allows for yield-bearing stablecoins**. While most other regimes prohibit this purely from a financial perspective, ADGM realized that institutional investors prefer using them as a **form of collateral**.\n*   **Formalizing Regulation:** ADGM continues to formalize rules, with a consultation paper for **staking** recently released, and plans to formalize rules for **VA borrowing and lending** in the next two quarters.\n*   **Industry Reliance:** ADGM moved away from a strict approval-based regime for crypto assets toward greater **reliance on the industry** to conduct their own due diligence.\n\n### IV. The Regulatory Sandbox\n\nA key tool for ADGM's ability to adapt and adjust policy is its **sandbox**. This is a designated place for the regulator to **experiment with policies**.\n\n*   **On-Chain Innovation:** ADGM currently hosts a firm that issues **on-chain credit** where **everything is native** (e.g., auction processes, borrowing, and lending occur in the on-chain environment). This firm bypasses the need to tokenize paper-based real-world assets.\n\n### V. Global Engagement\n\nADGM participates in global standard-setting bodies like **IOSCO and BCBS**. It exercises thought leadership by bringing global regulators together to converse and seek **regulatory harmony**.\n\nADGM organizes the **Abu Dhabi Finance Week** every year to connect traditional finance (TradFi), new finance (NewFi), and sustainable finance on the same platform over four days. This event typically occurs after the Formula 1 Abu Dhabi race in early December.\n\n## The Pulsation of the Commons: A Historical Vision of Web3 and Cosmolocalism\n\n### I. The Historical Thesis: The Pulsation of the Commons\n\nThe presentation introduces a historical vision of Web3 and crypto based on the study of macro historians. The core hypothesis is the **\"pulsation of\n\nThe presentation introduces a historical vision of Web3 and crypto based on the study of macro historians. The core hypothesis is the **\"pulsation of the commons,\"** which argues that civilization has forgotten about the **commons**—the third most important institution, alongside the state and the market.\n\n*   **Cyclical Nature:** Historically, markets and states are seen as perpetually switching dominance (\"back and forth\"). However, the health of the commons operates cyclically: when markets and states **do well, the commons go down**. Conversely, when markets and states **start functioning less and go down, the commons go up**.\n*   **Hegemony in Dark Ages:** Most interestingly, when a **dark age** occurs and markets and states almost completely disappear, the **commons become hegemonic**. This is evidenced by the role of monasteries in the revival of Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire, and Buddhist monastics in China and Japan.\n\n### II. Historical Forms of the Commons\n\nThroughout history, the commons served to balance the **\"extractive exaggerations\"** of the market and state, which constantly compete with each other and overuse their land base.\n\n| Historical Period | Form of Commons | Details |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Indigenous Period** | Communal shareholding and the gift | These were the main value exchange systems; markets and the state were marginal or non-existent. |\n| **Pre-Capitalist/Medieval** | Common land (Physical Commons) | In the European Middle Ages, common land was managed by the village and was crucial alongside the lord's land and the farmer's own land. |\n| **Modernity (16th Century)** | Enclosures/Statification | The **physical commons were destroyed** by the enclosures of the 16th century. Displaced farmers moved to cities and created the **social commons** (e.g., welfare organizations of labor), which subsequently underwent **statification** to become the welfare state. |\n\n### III. The Digital Commons and Revival\n\nThe commons experienced a major revival starting in the late 20th century:\n\n*   **1993: Digital Knowledge Commons:** The democratization of digital networks created vast **digital knowledge commons**, bringing the concept back into the consciousness and practice of millions of people.\n*   **2008: Urban and Rural Commons:** Following the financial crash, loads of young people facing high unemployment (30% to 50% in some European countries) created a **massive amount of urban and rural commons**. One study noted that a single city went from 50 urban commons to 500 in just ten years.\n\n### IV. Cosmolocalism and the Role of Crypto\n\nThe presentation concludes with the concept of **Cosmolocalism** and a proposal for integrating Web3 with local regenerative efforts.\n\n*   **Definition:** Cosmolocalism is the combination where **\"everything that's heavy is local, is relocized, and everything that's light is global and shared\"**.\n*   **Critique of Crypto Exit:** The speaker views crypto primarily as an **exit strategy**, which is **\"very dangerous\"** if only used for arbitrage of territory and moving around. If crypto communities are not seen as an ally of local people, they risk **rejection** during civilizational change.\n*   **Proposal for Integration:** The movement needs to create a link between the **coordination capacity of code and capital of Web3** and the **regenerative efforts of millions of people locally** who are trying to heal their land and soil.\n*   **Vision:** The goal is to establish some form of **fragmented or fractal capital** that would allow **investment of crypto capital into local regenerative projects** that are \"commons compatible\".\n\n## Fireside with Polychain's Olaf Carlson-Wee: Why Now is the Time for Network States\n\n### I. The Network State as a Post## Fireside with Polychain's Olaf Carlson-Wee: Why Now is the Time for Network States\n\n### I. The Network State as a Post-Bitcoin Evolution\n\nOlaf Carlson-Wee, the founder of Polychain, approaches the concept of network states and startup societies from an **investment perspective** and a **cryptocurrency mechanism design perspective**.\n\nHe asserts that the movement is transitioning from a \"pre-Bitcoin sort of startup society ecosystem\" to the equivalent of **\"really Bitcoin\"**. Historically, before Bitcoin, there were prototypes (like ecash, hash, bit gold, and Liberty Reserve) that were directionally correct but lacked the key components needed to succeed. The network state movement is now at that tipping point.\n\nBalaji characterizes this movement as the **\"third kind of thing\"** after internet companies and internet currencies, calling them **internet communities**.\n\n### II. The Dramatic Shift to Internet-Native Populations\n\nA major \"macro tailwind\" driving the current opportunity is the shift in generational adoption of the internet:\n\n*   **150x Growth:** Between 1995 and 2010, the number of people who grew up with an internet connection **grew by 150 times**.\n*   **Internet First:** This \"new generation\" is genuinely **internet first**, viewing the internet as their **home** or \"native place\".\n*   **Smartphone Ideology:** Balaji notes that 20th-century ideologies were based on the assembly line; today, every ideology must start on the **smartphone**.\n\nThis shift explains **\"why now\"**. Since more people are organizing via **online networks instead of geography**, the reliance on geographically organized systems—like fiat money and regulatory frameworks—becomes increasingly odd for online businesses. This situation is likened to having **region-locked electronics** or a **region-locked Gmail account** when crossing borders.\n\n### III. Speedrunning the Dubai and Singapore Models\n\nThe success of Dubai and Singapore proves the demand for a model based on governance and trade. These regions, which lacked natural resources, became the highest-growth economies by opening themselves up to **globalization, free trade**, and making themselves good places to live and do business.\n\nThe difference now is the availability of **the internet and cryptocurrency**, which provides **incentive design and mechanism design**. Network states can now **speedrun** the story of Dubai and Singapore significantly faster, potentially achieving similar growth in **10 or 15 years**, rather than multiple decades.\n\nThe massive scale of modern internet communities (e.g., WhatsApp, YouTube, TikTok are \"billion person apps\") shows the potential for groups to organize and materialize physically, which \"would change the world\".\n\n### IV. Monetary Decentralization and Future Community Design\n\n#### Currency and Unit of Account\nThe young generation often views **cryptocurrency as their \"native unit of account,\"** having to translate back to dollars. Bitcoin, in particular, has become the **benchmark** for returns in the space.\n\nIn macro terms, the world is moving away from Western denomination, marked by the decline of US Dollar (USD) dominance in global trade settlements (now under 50%). This shift is not leading to a replacement by the Chinese yuan, but rather to greater **decentralization**. This **\"global patchwork economy\"** creates more opportunity for an internet-native state to grow aggressively.\n\n#### The Concept of the Network School\nCarlson-Wee expressed strong optimism (**\"very bullish\"**) about the Network School concept. He notes that it is difficult to explain using comparative metaphors (e.g., \"imagine you had Stanford but it was just starting\") because it is defining a **\"new category\"**—the **\"secret third thing\"**—much like Polychain defined a new category of crypto funds.\n\nIf Carlson-Wee were to found a network state, it would be **aesthetically based**. He values the **\"vibes\"** and would prioritize **editability over luxury**. He suggests that these communities should be built as **\"startup communities,\"** like a **\"pirate ship,\"** prioritizing potential over immediate perks.","headings":[{"level":2,"text":"Forma and
