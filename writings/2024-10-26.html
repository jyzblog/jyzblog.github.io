<p><em>October 25, 2024</em></p>
<h2>Chapter 1: The Power of Private Equity</h2>
<p>Private equity has experienced significant growth over the past 30 years, evolving from a niche strategy to a dominant force in the global economy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thirty years ago, private equity was a small industry, with few institutional investors understanding or committing to the strategy.</li>
<li>Leveraged buyouts of cash-flowing, founder-run businesses were the main type of private equity deals.</li>
<li>Media attention on leveraged buyouts in the late 1980s, highlighted by books like <em>Barbarians at the Gate</em> and <em>The Predatorâ€™s Ball,</em> focused on extravagant deals and the controversy surrounding Drexel Burnham Lambert&#x27;s bankruptcy, which kept institutions away from private equity for about a decade.</li>
<li>Over the last 20 years, private equity transformed from a small allocation held by a select group of investors to a large, powerful force sought after by many.</li>
<li>The industry&#x27;s influence has expanded from a small segment of the private business world to affecting all aspects of the global economy.</li>
<li>Public awareness of private equity is increasing due to several factors:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Large alternative asset management firms like Blackstone, Apollo, KKR, and TPG have become publicly traded companies.</li>
<li>Mainstream media regularly reports on new private equity deals.</li>
<li>Books like Sachin Khajuria&#x27;s <em>Two and Twenty</em> provide an insider&#x27;s perspective on the industry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Private equity&#x27;s growth is fueled by institutional and individual investors (LPs) who commit capital to funds managed by private equity firms (GPs).<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The returns generated by private equity have attracted significant capital from institutional investors like:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Retirement funds for public workers and corporations</li>
<li>University endowments</li>
<li>Nonprofit foundations</li>
<li>Hospitals</li>
<li>Insurance companies</li>
<li>Sovereign wealth funds</li>
<li>Family offices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Individuals are also increasingly investing in private equity.</li>
<li>Essentially, retirees, students, beneficiaries of nonprofits, hospital patients, and people with savings are the ultimate owners of the businesses private equity invests in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Chapter 2: Requisite Disclaimer</h2>
<p>The author acknowledges that the nature of private equity firms makes it hard to avoid bias when talking about transactions. The firms are biased towards sharing their successes. To reduce cherry-picking of deals discussed on the podcast and in the book, the author decided to only include companies that were current portfolio companies or recent exits.</p>
<p>This still presents some bias:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a selection bias from the dealmakers in choosing what to share.</li>
<li>Deals under ownership may be off to a good start but are not guaranteed to be successful.</li>
</ul>
<p>The author also outlines how the firms were selected for each season of the podcast.</p>
<h4>Season 1</h4>
<p>The author chose 8 well-known private equity firms with long track records of success and allowed each firm to choose a deal to discuss. This introduces survivorship bias, as only large, historically successful firms were included. Their future success, however, is not guaranteed.</p>
<h4>Season 2</h4>
<p>The author shifted the focus from the private equity firms to the companies themselves, selecting companies that were familiar to a general audience.</p>
<p>From those two seasons, the deals included in the book were chosen to represent a wide range of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prior owners</li>
<li>Investment theses</li>
<li>Deal types</li>
<li>Sizes</li>
<li>Operational playbooks</li>
</ul>
<p>The author emphasizes that this is not a comprehensive set of case studies representing the whole industry, which is too large and constantly evolving.</p>
<p>The author notes that there is another important disclaimer to consider: the timing of the deals. The interviews were conducted in 2022 and 2023, while the deals themselves occurred in previous years. All of the deals in the book took place before the Federal Reserve&#x27;s interest rate hike in March 2022.</p>
<p>This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>The deals were financed at lower rates than what would be possible in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, the deals were all affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in some way. Some firms were presented with buying opportunities, while others saw their revenues drop to zero.</p>
<h2>Chapter 3: The Limited Partner&#x27;s Perspective: Part 1 Hamilton Lane</h2>
<p>This chapter provides a perspective of the private equity industry from a Limited Partner (LP). The chapter features an interview with Mario Giannini, the Executive Co-Chairman of Hamilton Lane, one of the largest investors in private equity funds.</p>
<ul>
<li>GPs and LPs are partners, and both share in the economics of successful deals, although this shared interest in success is sometimes forgotten in critiques of the industry.</li>
<li>LPs, who are the primary source of capital for private equity investments, represent a broad range of institutions and individuals, including retirees, students, beneficiaries of non-profits, hospital patients, and those with savings.</li>
<li>LPs are responsible for sourcing, researching, evaluating, selecting, and monitoring private equity managers, aiming to find managers who consistently outperform the public markets.</li>
<li>The dynamics between GPs and LPs can sometimes be strained, with GPs often viewing LPs simply as a source of capital and failing to understand their perspectives and needs.</li>
<li>Giannini believes that advisory boards, where LPs and GPs interact, are largely ineffective. He argues that meaningful relationships built on mutual respect and information sharing are far more valuable.</li>
<li>Giannini emphasizes that while price is a factor in private equity deals, it should not be the sole focus, as other aspects like the quality of the business and management team are more crucial.</li>
<li>He criticizes the industry&#x27;s overemphasis on deal selection and downplays the importance of portfolio construction.</li>
<li>He advocates for the use of data and analytics in portfolio construction to better understand the impact of different investment decisions on risk and return.</li>
<li>Giannini expresses his preference for detailed dashboards, similar to those used in public markets, to assess portfolio risk and the potential impact of factors like interest rates and commodity prices.</li>
<li>He criticizes the industry&#x27;s lack of attention to fees, noting a tendency to overlook significant fee differences that would be closely scrutinized in public markets.</li>
<li>Giannini offers a contrarian viewpoint on continuation funds, suggesting that they are not inherently negative. He argues that as long as high-quality companies are involved, continuation funds can provide a way for GPs to retain control of good businesses and manage LP preferences.</li>
<li>He acknowledges concerns about potential greed and the possibility of continuation funds being used for less desirable deals but believes the industry has not reached that point.</li>
<li>Giannini highlights LP saturation as a significant issue in private equity. This saturation stems from the denominator effect, where declines in public market values increase the proportion of private assets in portfolios, pushing investors above their target allocations.</li>
<li>He also points to the fundraising success of private equity in recent years, which has resulted in an influx of capital that LPs are struggling to deploy effectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, Chapter 3 presents the perspective of a seasoned LP in the private equity industry, offering insights into the dynamics between GPs and LPs, portfolio construction, current market challenges, and the importance of a long-term, value-driven approach to investing.</p>
<h2>Chapter 4: The Limited Partner&#x27;s Perspective: Part 2 HarbourVest Partners</h2>
<p>This chapter focuses on <strong>the role of Limited Partners (LPs) in the private equity industry, as seen through the lens of HarbourVest Partners, one of the world&#x27;s most influential investors in private equity strategies.</strong> The chapter is structured as an interview between Ted Seides and John Toomey, a Managing Director at HarbourVest, and covers topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Evolution of Due Diligence in Private Equity:</strong> John explains how the due diligence process has evolved significantly over the last 20 years.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data and Analytics:</strong> While data was limited in the past, LPs now have access to extensive data sets and analytics that allow them to thoroughly analyze a manager&#x27;s track record and investment strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Secondaries and Directs:</strong> The rise of secondary markets and direct co-investments has provided LPs with additional avenues for evaluating managers and their portfolio companies.</li>
<li><strong>Operational Due Diligence (ODD):</strong> ODD has become an essential part of the process, enabling LPs to assess a manager&#x27;s operational capabilities and their ability to create value in portfolio companies.</li>
<li><strong>ESG:</strong>  Environmental, social, and governance factors have become increasingly important considerations for LPs, reflecting a growing awareness of the non-financial aspects of investments.</li>
<li><strong>Distributable Net Income (DNI):</strong>  The focus on DNI highlights the importance of understanding how and when returns are generated and distributed to investors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manager Playbooks:</strong> John emphasizes the importance of understanding a manager&#x27;s &quot;playbook&quot; - their specific strategies and tactics for generating returns.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple Arbitrage vs. Operational Improvements:</strong> He distinguishes between strategies focused on buying low and selling high (multiple arbitrage) and those that involve actively improving the operations of portfolio companies to drive growth and profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Consistent Performers:</strong> HarbourVest seeks managers who can consistently generate attractive returns across different market cycles, not just those who excel in specific environments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Co-investment Insights:</strong> John highlights how HarbourVest&#x27;s co-investment activities provide valuable insights into the capabilities and decision-making processes of fund managers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alignment of Interests:</strong>  Co-investments allow HarbourVest to observe how managers navigate situations involving multiple investors, particularly in terms of aligning interests and making difficult decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Identifying True Leaders:</strong> John emphasizes that co-investments provide a &quot;front-row seat&quot; to see which managers are actively driving value creation and which ones are simply passive investors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategic Advantages of Secondaries:</strong> John discusses the strategic advantages of investing in secondary markets.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early Performance and Liquidity:</strong> Secondaries offer faster capital deployment, eliminate the J curve, and provide early performance and liquidity compared to primary investments.</li>
<li><strong>Diversification and Risk Management:</strong> Secondaries allow for broad diversification, reducing risk and enhancing portfolio stability.</li>
<li><strong>Limitations in Portfolio Construction:</strong>  While secondaries offer diversification benefits, they can limit the LP&#x27;s ability to precisely construct a portfolio aligned with specific investment objectives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Growth of the Secondary Market:</strong> John observes the significant growth and evolution of the secondary market.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shift from Distressed Sellers to GP-led Transactions:</strong>  He notes a shift from a market dominated by distressed sellers to a more mature market where GP-led transactions have become increasingly prevalent.</li>
<li><strong>New Opportunities and Investor Base:</strong>  This evolution has expanded the range of investible opportunities and attracted a broader and more sophisticated investor base.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Global Investment Perspective:</strong> John outlines HarbourVest&#x27;s approach to global investments.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opportunistic Approach:</strong>  The firm seeks attractive investment opportunities across various markets, adapting its strategies and tactics based on market conditions and local dynamics.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Developed Markets:</strong>  Historically, HarbourVest has focused on investments in developed markets, particularly in North America and Europe, where they have a deep understanding and extensive networks.</li>
<li><strong>Emerging Markets:</strong>  While HarbourVest has made some investments in emerging markets like China and Vietnam, their primary focus remains on developed economies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learning from Best Practices:</strong> John explains how HarbourVest continuously seeks to improve its operations by learning from the best practices of the private equity firms they invest in.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Succession Planning:</strong>  He highlights the importance of adopting a stewardship model for succession planning, ensuring a smooth transition of leadership and ownership within the firm.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Decision-Making:</strong>  John describes how HarbourVest adopted a numerical rating system for investment decisions, inspired by TA Associates, to enhance the rigor and objectivity of their investment process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Challenges of a Global Business:</strong> John acknowledges the increasing complexities and challenges of managing a global business in today&#x27;s dynamic environment.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reliance on Scale and Breadth:</strong>  HarbourVest leverages its scale and breadth of expertise to navigate these complexities and adapt to changing market conditions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall, Chapter 4 offers a comprehensive view of the LP perspective in private equity investing, emphasizing the importance of data, analytics, manager selection, operational expertise, and continuous improvement.</strong> John&#x27;s insights into HarbourVest&#x27;s strategies and practices highlight the sophisticated approach taken by leading LPs to generate attractive returns in this dynamic asset class.</p>
<h2>Chapter 5: The General Partner&#x27;s Perspective: Sachin Khajuria, Former Partner at Apollo Global Management</h2>
<p>This chapter focuses on the perspective of Sachin Khajuria, a former General Partner (GP) at Apollo Global Management who has transitioned to the role of a Limited Partner (LP). The chapter highlights the key attributes of successful GPs and the advantages of larger firms, while also acknowledging the potential of the mid-market. It emphasizes the importance of public understanding of private equity and provides insights into deal sourcing, valuation, and the evolution of the industry.</p>
<h3>Key Attributes of Successful GPs:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alignment:</strong> This refers to the GP&#x27;s commitment to their investors and the alignment of interests between the two parties. Successful GPs prioritize long-term value creation and are willing to &quot;clean up the mess&quot; even when things get difficult. They demonstrate a strong work ethic and a commitment to delivering results for their investors, going beyond a simple &quot;buy low, sell high&quot; mentality.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge Base:</strong> Leading firms have a wealth of data, experience, and networks, referred to as &quot;the library,&quot; that give them an edge. This institutional knowledge is built over time and cannot be easily replicated, providing insights into industries, companies, and market trends.</li>
<li><strong>Temperament:</strong> Successful GPs possess the temperament to navigate market cycles and long-term investments. They can &quot;pivot when they need to pivot, stick when they need to stick,&quot; and maintain a long-term perspective focused on achieving desired outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Advantages of Larger Firms:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diversification:</strong> Larger firms tend to have a wider range of strategies and expertise, allowing them to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on opportunities in different markets and sectors.</li>
<li><strong>Information Advantage:</strong> Their size allows them to gather more information from various sources, including their different strategies, portfolio companies, and industry networks. This gives them a better understanding of market trends, potential risks, and investment opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Scale:</strong> They have the resources to handle larger, more complex deals, putting them in a unique position to compete for and acquire high-value assets.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Mid-Market:</h3>
<p>While acknowledging the advantages of larger firms, Khajuria also recognizes the potential of the mid-market. He argues that success in the mid-market hinges on the quality of the people and their ability to adapt to changing market environments. Historically, smaller market segments have yielded attractive returns due to being &quot;less heavily mined&quot;. Scaling up or down in size is feasible with the right team and expertise.</p>
<h3>Public Understanding of Private Equity:</h3>
<p>Khajuria emphasizes the need for greater public understanding of private equity. He argues that this is crucial for improving the industry&#x27;s public image and making it more accessible to a broader range of investors. Increased awareness would benefit both investors and the industry by &quot;lowering the noise&quot; and fostering greater transparency.</p>
<h3>Deal Sourcing:</h3>
<p>While the term &quot;proprietary deal&quot; is frequently used, Khajuria points out that it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain exclusivity in large transactions. Sellers often have obligations to their stakeholders, necessitating engagement with investment banks and potentially multiple bidders. While complete secrecy may be challenging, building relationships and proactively seeking opportunities can give firms a competitive edge.</p>
<h3>Valuation:</h3>
<p>Khajuria acknowledges that valuations have increased across the board in private equity. This makes it even more important for firms to be disciplined in their approach and to avoid overpaying for assets. He suggests focusing on businesses with strong fundamentals, growth potential, and cash flow generation to justify higher valuations and deliver attractive returns.</p>
<h3>Evolution of Private Equity:</h3>
<p>Khajuria notes that private equity has evolved significantly, with the industry becoming much larger and more sophisticated. The increasing complexity and scale of deals require GPs to be more strategic in their approach, leveraging their expertise, resources, and networks to create value for their investors.</p>
<p>This chapter emphasizes the importance of alignment, knowledge, and temperament as key attributes of successful GPs. While highlighting the advantages of larger firms, it acknowledges the potential of the mid-market and stresses the need for greater public understanding of private equity. The chapter offers valuable insights into the world of private equity from the perspective of a seasoned professional who has experienced both sides of the industry.</p>
<h2>Chapter 6: The Perfect Buyout: CHI Overhead Doors by KKR</h2>
<p>This chapter focuses on KKR&#x27;s acquisition of CHI Overhead Doors, highlighting the characteristics of an ideal private equity target and the strategies employed to enhance value during ownership.</p>
<h3>An Ideal Target</h3>
<p>The chapter begins by outlining the traits of a business that make it an attractive target for private equity acquisition. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strong Free Cash Flow Generation:</strong> This provides financial flexibility and the ability to service debt.</li>
<li><strong>Consistent and Growing Revenue:</strong>  Demonstrates market demand and the potential for future expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Resilience to Economic Cycles:</strong>  Ensures stability and minimizes risk during downturns.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing Power:</strong> Allows the company to maintain profitability even with rising costs.</li>
<li><strong>Diverse Customer Base:</strong> Reduces reliance on any single customer and mitigates risk.</li>
<li><strong>Efficient Cost Structure:</strong>  Provides opportunities for further optimization and margin expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Strong Management Team:</strong>  Ensures effective execution of the business plan.</li>
</ul>
<h3>CHI Overhead Doors: A Case Study</h3>
<p>CHI Overhead Doors exemplifies many of these ideal characteristics. It held a strong market position in the garage door industry, benefited from steady demand driven by replacement needs, and possessed a solid management team.</p>
<h3>KKR&#x27;s Acquisition Strategy</h3>
<p>KKR&#x27;s approach to acquiring CHI Overhead Doors involved a multi-stage preemptive process, aiming to secure the deal before a competitive auction could take place.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aggressive Bidding:</strong> KKR progressively increased its offer price, demonstrating its strong interest in the business.</li>
<li><strong>Creating Urgency:</strong>  KKR emphasized the time sensitivity of its offer, suggesting that it would move on if a deal couldn&#x27;t be reached quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Psychological Tactics:</strong>  KKR used strategic communication to convey its commitment and persuade the seller to forgo a full auction process.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value Creation Strategies</h3>
<p>During its ownership of CHI Overhead Doors, KKR implemented several strategies to enhance the company&#x27;s value:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operational Improvements:</strong> KKR focused on streamlining manufacturing processes, reducing lead times, and improving delivery efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Leadership Development:</strong>  KKR brought in outside expertise and consultants to support the existing management team and drive operational excellence.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy Deployment:</strong> KKR employed the &quot;Hoshin Kanri&quot; framework, also known as strategy deployment or policy deployment, to cascade priorities throughout the organization, ensuring alignment and focus on key initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Ownership:</strong> KKR implemented an employee stock ownership plan, granting employees a stake in the company&#x27;s success and fostering motivation and alignment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overcoming Challenges</h3>
<p>Despite the initial success of these strategies, KKR faced setbacks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Plant closures and staffing shortages impacted operations. However, the company recovered strongly, regaining its momentum and exceeding its pre-pandemic performance.</p>
<h3>Exit Strategy</h3>
<p>KKR&#x27;s exit strategy for CHI Overhead Doors aligned with its general philosophy of selling when 80% of the planned value creation had been achieved and market conditions were favorable. The sale multiple didn&#x27;t increase significantly, but the return on investment was exceptional due to operational improvements and the impact of employee ownership.</p>
<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<p>The CHI Overhead Doors case study illustrates the power of combining a disciplined acquisition strategy with a comprehensive value creation plan. KKR&#x27;s approach highlights the importance of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identifying High-Quality Businesses:</strong>  Target companies with strong fundamentals and potential for growth.</li>
<li><strong>Preemptive Dealmaking:</strong> Secure attractive deals before competition drives up prices.</li>
<li><strong>Operational Expertise:</strong>  Leverage internal and external resources to optimize operations and drive efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Engagement:</strong>  Align incentives and foster ownership to motivate employees and maximize performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that this chapter presents a single case study and might not represent the full range of private equity strategies or the challenges associated with them.</p>
<h2>Chapter 7: Everyone Wins - Parts Town by Berkshire Partners</h2>
<p>This chapter focuses on <strong>Berkshire Partnersâ€™ acquisition of Parts Town</strong>, highlighting a more collaborative and relationship-focused approach to private equity, contrasting the negative stereotypes often associated with the industry.</p>
<h3>Berkshire Partners</h3>
<ul>
<li>Based in Boston and manages <strong>$20 billion</strong></li>
<li>Known for its collaborative culture and responsible investing approach</li>
<li>Values <strong>long-term relationships</strong>, with nearly three-quarters of its deals involving the seller rolling equity into the ownership structure during Berkshire&#x27;s ownership period</li>
</ul>
<h3>Parts Town</h3>
<ul>
<li>A distributor of replacement parts for restaurants</li>
<li>Exemplifies characteristics of a <strong>strong business</strong>:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Supplies 150,000 essential but individually low-cost parts, diversifying its revenue stream</li>
<li>Consistent revenue growth for almost 20 years until the COVID-19 pandemic</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deal Background</h3>
<ul>
<li>Berkshire Partners had <strong>prior knowledge of the industry</strong> through due diligence on related businesses</li>
<li>Identified Parts Town as a <strong>top performer</strong> in the industry</li>
<li>Berkshire Partners cultivated a relationship with Parts Town&#x27;s management team, exploring acquisition opportunities together</li>
<li>When the prior owner (Summit Partners) decided to sell, Berkshire <strong>preempted the deal process</strong></li>
<li>This demonstrates Berkshire&#x27;s proactive approach and the value of building relationships.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deal Dynamics</h3>
<ul>
<li>The deal was preempted at a <strong>15x EBITDA multiple</strong>, considered aggressive at the time</li>
<li>Summit Partners <strong>rolled over some of its equity</strong>, indicating a positive outlook for the business and confidence in Berkshire Partners</li>
<li>Both Berkshire and Parts Town had <strong>strong values-based cultures</strong>, facilitating a smooth partnership</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value Creation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Parts Town&#x27;s earnings <strong>grew eightfold</strong> during the first seven years of Berkshireâ€™s ownership</li>
<li>Initially driven equally by <strong>organic growth and M&amp;A</strong>, later shifting to 60% M&amp;A and 40% organic growth</li>
<li>Berkshire <strong>supported Parts Town&#x27;s M&amp;A strategy</strong>, providing resources and guidance for larger deals while enabling Parts Town to handle smaller tuck-in acquisitions independently</li>
<li>They also focused on <strong>operational improvements</strong>, with Berkshire providing resources and guidance while allowing Parts Town to maintain ownership and accountability</li>
<li>This highlights Berkshire&#x27;s collaborative approach, empowering Parts Town to leverage its expertise while providing support and resources.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recapitalization</h3>
<ul>
<li>After five and a half years, Berkshire conducted a <strong>recapitalization</strong>, providing liquidity to the older fund and allowing management to participate while remaining invested</li>
<li>This unusual move reflected Berkshire&#x27;s <strong>long-term view</strong> and desire to continue the partnership</li>
<li>The recapitalization process involved a competitive process, ultimately leading to a new ownership structure including Leonard Green Partners and Roark Capital</li>
<li>The new investors brought relevant experience, and the transition was marked by transparency and collaboration, with open dialogue about goals and concerns</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preparation and Relationships:</strong> Berkshire Partners&#x27; prior industry knowledge and existing relationship with Parts Town enabled them to act quickly and secure a favorable deal.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborative Approach:</strong> Berkshire Partners worked closely with Parts Town&#x27;s management team, providing support and resources while respecting their expertise and autonomy.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Perspective:</strong> The recapitalization demonstrated Berkshire Partners&#x27; commitment to the long-term success of Parts Town and its management team.</li>
<li><strong>Shared Values:</strong> The alignment of values between Berkshire Partners and Parts Town contributed to a strong partnership.</li>
<li><strong>Finding the &quot;Winners&quot;:</strong> The chapter emphasizes the importance of identifying companies with strong leadership, market position, and capabilities, recognizing that their potential may exceed initial projections.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chapter 7 in Context</h3>
<p>Chapter 7 stands in contrast to the previous chapter, which focused on KKR&#x27;s acquisition of CHI Overhead Doors. While both deals were successful, the approach and dynamics differed. KKR took a more hands-on approach, bringing in new management and implementing operational changes. Berkshire Partners, in contrast, focused on empowering Parts Town&#x27;s existing management team while providing support and resources. This difference highlights the diversity of approaches within the private equity industry and the importance of tailoring strategies to the specific circumstances of each deal.</p>
<h2>Chapter 8: Trophy Assets Winning Championships, Fenway Sports by Arctos Sports Partners</h2>
<p>This chapter focuses on <strong>Arctos Sports Partners&#x27; acquisition of a minority stake in Fenway Sports Group (FSG)</strong>.</p>
<h3>Background and Investment Thesis</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arctos Sports Partners</strong> is a private equity firm specializing in <strong>investments in professional sports franchises and related businesses</strong>.</li>
<li>They believe professional sports is a compelling investment due to factors like:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Scarcity value:</strong> There are a limited number of professional sports teams.</li>
<li><strong>Growing global fan base:</strong> The popularity of professional sports continues to rise globally.</li>
<li><strong>Media rights deals:</strong> Lucrative media rights agreements provide consistent revenue streams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fenway Sports Group (FSG)</h3>
<ul>
<li>FSG is a <strong>sports and entertainment company</strong> that owns a portfolio of assets, including:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The Boston Red Sox (MLB)</li>
<li>Liverpool Football Club (Premier League)</li>
<li>Fenway Park</li>
<li>Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing (NASCAR)</li>
<li>New England Sports Network (NESN)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deal Dynamics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Arctos acquired a <strong>minority stake</strong> in FSG from a sophisticated family office seeking partial liquidity.</li>
<li>The deal was structured to provide Arctos with:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Downside protection</strong></li>
<li><strong>Duration enhancement</strong></li>
<li><strong>Return enhancement</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The acquisition process involved navigating <strong>league approvals</strong>, which can be challenging for first-time investors in sports franchises.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Due Diligence</h3>
<ul>
<li>Arctos conducted due diligence similar to any other direct investment.</li>
<li>Professional sports businesses have <strong>audited financial statements, board packs, and undergo league audits</strong>, providing ample information for due diligence.</li>
<li>The challenge lies in the <strong>uniqueness of these businesses</strong> and the need to model factors like:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared beta factors</strong> (e.g., league-wide trends)</li>
<li><strong>Local execution factors</strong> (e.g., team performance)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Stochastic and probabilistic modeling</strong> are necessary to account for these unique factors.</li>
<li>The deal took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, with no games being played, requiring Arctos to <strong>factor in potential uncertainties</strong> like:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>A possible MLB labor strike</li>
<li>An upcoming national TV contract deal in MLB</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Valuation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Arctos determined a price by conducting an <strong>intrinsic value assessment</strong>, a process they also use for other asset classes like private equity, real estate, and infrastructure.</li>
<li>While acknowledging the <strong>&quot;trophy asset&quot; perception</strong> of sports franchises, Arctos emphasized that they are <strong>ultimately businesses</strong> with cash flows that can be valued.</li>

<h2>Chapter 12: I&#x27;ll Take Three of Those Beauties Please: Orveon by Advent International</h2>
<p>This chapter examines Advent International&#x27;s acquisition of three beauty brands from Shiseido, forming a new company named Orveon. It focuses on the complexities and strategic considerations involved in corporate carveouts, highlighting the risks and opportunities associated with this type of private equity deal.</p>
<h3>Corporate Carveouts: A Unique Opportunity</h3>
<p>The chapter starts by explaining the nature of corporate carveouts, where a parent company decides to sell a business unit that no longer aligns with its core strategy.  These carveouts present attractive opportunities for private equity firms for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Undervalued Assets:</strong>  Often, these divested units haven&#x27;t received sufficient attention or investment from the parent company, leading to untapped potential for improvement and growth.</li>
<li><strong>Motivated Sellers:</strong>  Corporations looking to divest are usually more focused on streamlining their operations and may prioritize a swift transaction over maximizing the sale price. This can provide private equity buyers with a favorable entry valuation.</li>
<li><strong>Transformation Potential:</strong>  By separating from the larger corporate structure, carveouts gain the flexibility to implement strategic changes, improve operational efficiency, and pursue focused growth strategies.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>Despite the strategic appeal, corporate carveouts come with inherent risks and challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complex Separation Process:</strong>  Untangling the carved-out unit from the parent company involves numerous intricate steps, including negotiating transition services agreements, establishing independent infrastructure, and transferring essential functions like IT, finance, and human resources.</li>
<li><strong>Operational Disruptions:</strong>  The transition period can create disruptions to the business, requiring careful planning and execution to minimize any negative impact on operations and customer relationships.</li>
<li><strong>Financing Hurdles:</strong>  Without standalone financial statements, securing debt financing for a carveout can be difficult. Sellers may need to provide financing through seller notes to bridge the gap.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Orveon: A Complex Carveout</h3>
<p>The case of Orveon highlights the intricacies of a corporate carveout. Advent International acquired three beauty brands â€“ bareMinerals, Laura Mercier, and Buxom â€“ from the Japanese conglomerate Shiseido. Advent initiated the deal during the pandemic, a time when the beauty industry was significantly impacted, with sales of these brands almost at a standstill.</p>
<p>The negotiations and separation process were complex, requiring agreements on various aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong>  Ensuring clear ownership of brand trademarks and patents.</li>
<li><strong>Contracts:</strong>  Transferring or renegotiating supplier and customer contracts for the new entity.</li>
<li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong>  Establishing independent manufacturing processes or securing agreements with Shiseido for a transition period.</li>
<li><strong>R&amp;D:</strong>  Determining the ownership and future development of products in the pipeline.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Infrastructure:</strong>  Setting up independent financial systems and processes.</li>
<li><strong>Digital Infrastructure:</strong>  Migrating or creating websites, social media accounts, and other digital assets.</li>
<li><strong>Data:</strong>  Negotiating access and ownership of customer and operational data.</li>
<li><strong>Personnel:</strong>  Transferring or hiring employees to staff the new organization.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Advent&#x27;s Approach</h3>
<p>Advent International brought its extensive experience in corporate carveouts and a commitment to transforming businesses to the Orveon deal. The firm implemented a multi-faceted strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Experienced Leadership:</strong>  Recruiting a seasoned CEO, Pascal Houdayer, with a proven track record in the beauty industry and experience in acquisitions and brand management.</li>
<li><strong>Rapid Team Building:</strong> Assembling a complete senior executive team within eight months of acquiring the business.</li>
<li><strong>Incentive Alignment:</strong> Implementing incentive plans that required personal investment from the executive team, fostering ownership and commitment.</li>
<li><strong>Operational Support:</strong>  Leveraging Advent&#x27;s internal portfolio support group and operations advisors to guide the new management team in establishing essential business functions, including IT, finance, HR, supply chain, and procurement.</li>
<li><strong>Digital Transformation:</strong>  Developing and implementing a nine-part digital value creation plan, including enlisting an Advent employee as the interim head of digital.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural Transformation:</strong>  Defining Orveon&#x27;s unique values and establishing a distinct culture for the newly independent company.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financing the Deal</h3>
<p>Given the lack of independent financial data, Advent secured financing for Orveon through a seller note from Shiseido, avoiding the need for external debt in the initial stages. This provided flexibility for operational improvements and minimized financial pressure during the crucial transition period.</p>
<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
<p>The successful execution of the Orveon carveout involves ongoing efforts to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stabilize Operations:</strong> Addressing supply chain challenges and navigating inflationary pressures impacting the cost of goods.</li>
<li><strong>Drive Growth:</strong> Implementing strategic initiatives to expand the brands&#x27; market presence and capture growth opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Build a Strong Foundation:</strong>  Establishing a robust organizational structure, culture, and operational processes to support long-term success.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<p>The Orveon case study provides valuable insights into the dynamics of corporate carveouts, showcasing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Importance of Preparation:</strong> Thorough due diligence, comprehensive planning, and proactive engagement with stakeholders are crucial for navigating the complexities of carveouts.</li>
<li><strong>The Power of Partnerships:</strong>  Building strong relationships with the seller and key partners is essential for a smooth transition and ongoing support.</li>
<li><strong>The Value of Expertise:</strong>  Leveraging a network of experts and advisors can provide valuable guidance and accelerate the implementation of critical initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>The Benefits of Patience:</strong>  Carveouts require a long-term perspective, recognizing that transforming the business and unlocking its full potential takes time and sustained effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>This chapter emphasizes the need for a disciplined approach, operational expertise, and a strong commitment to transformation to succeed in corporate carveouts. The Orveon case serves as a reminder that, while complex and challenging, carveouts can offer significant rewards for private equity firms capable of navigating their intricacies.</p>
<h2>Chapter 13: You Bought What? Yahoo by Apollo Global Management</h2>
<p>This chapter explores Apollo Global Management&#x27;s acquisition of Yahoo, a seemingly contrarian investment given the brand&#x27;s decline from its peak during the dot-com bubble. The chapter emphasizes Apollo&#x27;s strategy of identifying undervalued, misunderstood assets and strategically enhancing their value.</p>
<h3>Apollo Global Management: A Distinctive Approach</h3>
<ul>
<li>Apollo prioritizes acquiring companies at a favorable price, emphasizing that <strong>&quot;purchase price matters&quot;</strong>.</li>
<li>Their strategy involves targeting <strong>&quot;misunderstood assets, diamonds in the rough,&quot;</strong> and improving them during their ownership period.</li>
<li>They aim to <strong>&quot;buy complexity and sell simplicity,&quot;</strong> seeking opportunities overlooked by others due to perceived complexity or negative perceptions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Yahoo: From Dot-com Darling to Acquisition Target</h3>
<ul>
<li>At its peak in 2000, Yahoo, along with AOL, held a combined market capitalization of <strong>$350 billion</strong>.</li>
<li>However, the business experienced a gradual decline in the following decades.</li>
<li>Verizon acquired AOL in 2015 and Yahoo in 2017, aiming to capitalize on digital media, but failed to achieve expected synergies.</li>
<li>Verizon decided to divest Yahoo in 2021 as it was a small, non-core asset.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Apollo&#x27;s Persistent Interest</h3>
<ul>
<li>David Sambur, co-head of equity at Apollo, initially explored acquiring Yahoo in 2017 when it was still a public company.</li>
<li>Apollo couldn&#x27;t compete with Verizon&#x27;s strategic acquisition at the time.</li>
<li>However, Sambur and his team gained familiarity with the business during due diligence and continued monitoring it.</li>
<li>When Verizon put Yahoo up for sale again in 2021, Apollo saw a renewed opportunity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Capitalizing on Market Misconceptions</h3>
<ul>
<li>The size of the asset, perceived lack of quality, and low growth expectations deterred many potential buyers.</li>
<li>This created an opportunity for Apollo to acquire Yahoo at a favorable price due to the <strong>&quot;baggage&quot;</strong> associated with the brand.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Acquisition and Turnaround</h3>
<ul>
<li>Apollo acquired Yahoo for <strong>$5 billion</strong>, a significant discount from its peak valuation.</li>
<li>They brought in a new CEO, Jim Lanzone, with experience in revitalizing digital media businesses.</li>
<li>Under Lanzone&#x27;s leadership, Yahoo focused on enhancing its core businesses, including Mail, Homepage, Search, Finance, and Sports, while also divesting non-core assets.</li>
<li>The turnaround strategy emphasized improving user experience, strengthening advertising technology, and leveraging the platform&#x27;s large user base.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open-mindedness and Due Diligence:</strong> Avoid snap judgments based on prevailing market perceptions and conduct thorough due diligence to uncover hidden value.</li>
<li><strong>Impact of Management:</strong>  Strong management teams can significantly enhance value creation.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptability and Pace of Change:</strong>  In dynamic industries like technology, adaptability and the ability to respond quickly to changing trends are crucial.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Success and Future Prospects</h3>
<ul>
<li>Under Apollo&#x27;s ownership, Yahoo&#x27;s value has increased substantially, highlighting the effectiveness of their contrarian investment approach.</li>
<li>The chapter implies that Apollo&#x27;s exit strategy will likely involve selling Yahoo at a significant premium to its acquisition price.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chapter 13 in Context</h3>
<p>This chapter reinforces Apollo&#x27;s distinctive investment philosophy, emphasizing their expertise in identifying undervalued assets and employing financial engineering, operational improvements, and strategic management changes to unlock their potential. It also highlights the importance of patience, conviction, and a willingness to go against prevailing market sentiment to capitalize on overlooked opportunities.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16: Private Skiing and a Public Mess: Yellowstone Club by CrossHarbor Capital Partners</h2>
<p>This chapter examines CrossHarbor Capital Partners&#x27; acquisition of the Yellowstone Club, a private ski and golf community in Montana, revealing the complexities of investing in trophy assets and the challenges of managing a high-end, niche business. The Yellowstone Club, despite its luxurious amenities and exclusive membership, faced financial distress and operational issues prior to CrossHarbor&#x27;s involvement. The chapter focuses on CrossHarborâ€™s strategy for reviving the club, navigating legal battles, and ultimately achieving a successful exit.</p>
<p><strong>The Yellowstone Club: A Trophy Asset in Distress:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Founded in 1997, the Yellowstone Club quickly gained a reputation as an exclusive haven for the ultra-wealthy, boasting world-class skiing, a renowned golf course, and luxurious real estate offerings.</li>
<li>By 2008, the club faced significant financial challenges, culminating in bankruptcy filings amidst the global financial crisis and legal disputes involving its founder.</li>

<li><strong>Strategic Partnerships:</strong> CrossHarbor formed strategic partnerships with key stakeholders, including real estate developers and hospitality operators, to enhance the club&#x27;s offerings and attract new members.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Achieving a Successful Exit:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After several years of ownership and operational improvements, CrossHarbor successfully sold the Yellowstone Club in 2016 to a group of investors, generating a significant return on their investment.</li>
<li>The sale demonstrated the potential for private equity firms to create value in distressed assets by navigating complexities, implementing strategic initiatives, and restoring investor confidence.</li>

<h2>Chapter 17: The Large World of Small Businesses: Selective Search by Permanent Equity</h2>
<p>Chapter 17 examines Permanent Equity&#x27;s acquisition of Selective Search, illustrating the firm&#x27;s unique investment approach in the vast landscape of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Permanent Equity distinguishes itself through its &quot;permanent capital&quot; model, which eschews the traditional private equity model of fixed-term funds in favor of holding businesses indefinitely.</p>
<h3>Permanent Equity&#x27;s Differentiators:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Permanent Capital:</strong> Unlike traditional private equity firms, Permanent Equity does not operate under a fixed-term fund structure. Instead, it invests capital from its balance sheet, allowing it to hold businesses indefinitely and eliminating the pressure to exit investments within a predetermined timeframe. This approach provides flexibility and stability, enabling the firm to make long-term decisions that align with the best interests of the businesses it acquires.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Focus on Owner Earnings:</strong>  Permanent Equity prioritizes companies with strong and sustainable owner earnings, which represent the true discretionary cash flow available to the business owner after accounting for essential capital expenditures. This focus ensures that acquired companies have a solid foundation for growth and can generate consistent cash flow to support their operations and expansion plans.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Selective Search: An Acquisition in the SME Landscape</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Company Overview:</strong> Selective Search is a retained executive search firm specializing in recruiting senior executives across various industries.  The company operates with a strong reputation for quality and personalized service, making it an attractive target for Permanent Equity&#x27;s investment philosophy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Acquisition Rationale:</strong> Permanent Equity saw Selective Search as a good fit for its permanent capital model due to the company&#x27;s consistent profitability, strong management team, and potential for long-term growth. The acquisition aligned with Permanent Equity&#x27;s strategy of acquiring businesses with stable earnings, a strong market position, and a capable leadership team.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value Creation Strategies:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Professionalization and Specialization:</strong> Permanent Equity focuses on helping acquired businesses improve their operational efficiency and professionalism. This includes streamlining roles and responsibilities, bringing in specialized talent to manage specific areas of the business, upgrading systems and processes, and establishing robust banking relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Growth Support:</strong> While Permanent Equity does not seek to impose drastic changes or disrupt existing operations, it actively supports growth initiatives through strategic investments, talent acquisition, and expansion into new markets or service offerings. The firm&#x27;s long-term perspective allows it to patiently invest in growth opportunities that may take time to materialize.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Financial Flexibility:</strong> The permanent capital model provides financial flexibility, enabling Permanent Equity to act as an internal source of debt financing for its portfolio companies. This eliminates reliance on external lenders and allows the firm to tailor financing terms to the specific needs of the business, as demonstrated by the example of deferring interest payments and repayments during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chapter 17 Key Takeaways:</h3>
<p>This chapter provides insights into:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The potential of investing in SMEs:</strong>  While large-scale private equity deals garner significant attention, the vast universe of SMEs presents compelling investment opportunities, particularly for firms with a long-term perspective and a focus on sustainable owner earnings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The benefits of the permanent capital model:</strong>  Permanent Equity&#x27;s permanent capital approach allows for greater flexibility, stability, and alignment with the long-term interests of the businesses it acquires. This model provides advantages in terms of financial flexibility, growth support, and long-term value creation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The importance of operational improvements and growth support:</strong>  While Permanent Equity does not pursue aggressive cost-cutting or financial engineering strategies, it recognizes the importance of operational efficiency and professionalization in driving sustainable growth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By showcasing Permanent Equity&#x27;s acquisition of Selective Search, Chapter 17 highlights a differentiated approach to private equity investing that emphasizes patient capital, operational excellence, and alignment with the long-term goals of the businesses it owns.</p>

</ul></article></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"content":"# Notes - Private Equity Deals\n*October 25, 2024*\n## Chapter 1: The Power of Private Equity\n\nPrivate equity has experienced significant growth over the past 30 years, evolving from a niche strategy to a dominant force in the global economy.\n\n* Thirty years ago, private equity was a small industry, with few institutional investors understanding or committing to the strategy.\n* Leveraged buyouts of cash-flowing, founder-run businesses were the main type of private equity deals.\n* Media attention on leveraged buyouts in the late 1980s, highlighted by books like *Barbarians at the Gate* and *The Predatorâ€™s Ball,* focused on extravagant deals and the controversy surrounding Drexel Burnham Lambert's bankruptcy, which kept institutions away from private equity for about a decade.\n* Over the last 20 years, private equity transformed from a small allocation held by a select group of investors to a large, powerful force sought after by many.\n* The industry's influence has expanded from a small segment of the private business world to affecting all aspects of the global economy.\n* Public awareness of private equity is increasing due to several factors:\n  * Large alternative asset management firms like Blackstone, Apollo, KKR, and TPG have become publicly traded companies.\n  * Mainstream media regularly reports on new private equity deals.\n  * Books like Sachin Khajuria's *Two and Twenty* provide an insider's perspective on the industry.\n* Private equity's growth is fueled by institutional and individual investors (LPs) who commit capital to funds managed by private equity firms (GPs).\n  * The returns generated by private equity have attracted significant capital from institutional investors like:\n    * Retirement funds for public workers and corporations\n    * University endowments\n    * Nonprofit foundations\n    * Hospitals\n    * Insurance companies\n    * Sovereign wealth funds\n    * Family offices\n  * Individuals are also increasingly investing in private equity.\n  * Essentially, retirees, students, beneficiaries of nonprofits, hospital patients, and people with savings are the ultimate owners of the businesses private equity invests in.\n\n## Chapter 2: Requisite Disclaimer\n\nThe author acknowledges that the nature of private equity firms makes it hard to avoid bias when talking about transactions. The firms are biased towards sharing their successes. To reduce cherry-picking of deals discussed on the podcast and in the book, the author decided to only include companies that were current portfolio companies or recent exits.\n\nThis still presents some bias:\n\n* There is a selection bias from the dealmakers in choosing what to share.\n* Deals under ownership may be off to a good start but are not guaranteed to be successful.\n\nThe author also outlines how the firms were selected for each season of the podcast.\n\n#### Season 1\n\nThe author chose 8 well-known private equity firms with long track records of success and allowed each firm to choose a deal to discuss. This introduces survivorship bias, as only large, historically successful firms were included. Their future success, however, is not guaranteed.\n\n#### Season 2\n\nThe author shifted the focus from the private equity firms to the companies themselves, selecting companies that were familiar to a general audience.\n\nFrom those two seasons, the deals included in the book were chosen to represent a wide range of:\n\n* Prior owners\n* Investment theses\n* Deal types\n* Sizes\n* Operational playbooks\n\nThe author emphasizes that this is not a comprehensive set of case studies representing the whole industry, which is too large and constantly evolving.\n\nThe author notes that there is another important disclaimer to consider: the timing of the deals. The interviews were conducted in 2022 and 2023, while the deals themselves occurred in previous years. All of the deals in the book took place before the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike in March 2022.\n\nThis means:\n\n* The deals were financed at lower rates than what would be possible in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, the deals were all affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in some way. Some firms were presented with buying opportunities, while others saw their revenues drop to zero.\n\n## Chapter 3: The Limited Partner's Perspective: Part 1 Hamilton Lane\n\nThis chapter provides a perspective of the private equity industry from a Limited Partner (LP). The chapter features an interview with Mario Giannini, the Executive Co-Chairman of Hamilton Lane, one of the largest investors in private equity funds.\n\n* GPs and LPs are partners, and both share in the economics of successful deals, although this shared interest in success is sometimes forgotten in critiques of the industry.\n* LPs, who are the primary source of capital for private equity investments, represent a broad range of institutions and individuals, including retirees, students, beneficiaries of non-profits, hospital patients, and those with savings.\n* LPs are responsible for sourcing, researching, evaluating, selecting, and monitoring private equity managers, aiming to find managers who consistently outperform the public markets.\n* The dynamics between GPs and LPs can sometimes be strained, with GPs often viewing LPs simply as a source of capital and failing to understand their perspectives and needs.\n* Giannini believes that advisory boards, where LPs and GPs interact, are largely ineffective. He argues that meaningful relationships built on mutual respect and information sharing are far more valuable.\n* Giannini emphasizes that while price is a factor in private equity deals, it should not be the sole focus, as other aspects like the quality of the business and management team are more crucial.\n* He criticizes the industry's overemphasis on deal selection and downplays the importance of portfolio construction.\n* He advocates for the use of data and analytics in portfolio construction to better understand the impact of different investment decisions on risk and return.\n* Giannini expresses his preference for detailed dashboards, similar to those used in public markets, to assess portfolio risk and the potential impact of factors like interest rates and commodity prices.\n* He criticizes the industry's lack of attention to fees, noting a tendency to overlook significant fee differences that would be closely scrutinized in public markets.\n* Giannini offers a contrarian viewpoint on continuation funds, suggesting that they are not inherently negative. He argues that as long as high-quality companies are involved, continuation funds can provide a way for GPs to retain control of good businesses and manage LP preferences.\n* He acknowledges concerns about potential greed and the possibility of continuation funds being used for less desirable deals but believes the industry has not reached that point.\n* Giannini highlights LP saturation as a significant issue in private equity. This saturation stems from the denominator effect, where declines in public market values increase the proportion of private assets in portfolios, pushing investors above their target allocations.\n* He also points to the fundraising success of private equity in recent years, which has resulted in an influx of capital that LPs are struggling to deploy effectively.\n\nIn summary, Chapter 3 presents the perspective of a seasoned LP in the private equity industry, offering insights into the dynamics between GPs and LPs, portfolio construction, current market challenges, and the importance of a long-term, value-driven approach to investing.\n\n## Chapter 4: The Limited Partner's Perspective: Part 2 HarbourVest Partners\n\nThis chapter focuses on **the role of Limited Partners (LPs) in the private equity industry, as seen through the lens of HarbourVest Partners, one of the world's most influential investors in private equity strategies.** The chapter is structured as an interview between Ted Seides and John Toomey, a Managing Director at HarbourVest, and covers topics such as:\n\n* **The Evolution of Due Diligence in Private Equity:** John explains how the due diligence process has evolved significantly over the last 20 years.\n  * **Data and Analytics:** While data was limited in the past, LPs now have access to extensive data sets and analytics that allow them to thoroughly analyze a manager's track record and investment strategies.\n  * **Secondaries and Directs:** The rise of secondary markets and direct co-investments has provided LPs with additional avenues for evaluating managers and their portfolio companies.\n  * **Operational Due Diligence (ODD):** ODD has become an essential part of the process, enabling LPs to assess a manager's operational capabilities and their ability to create value in portfolio companies.\n  * **ESG:**  Environmental, social, and governance factors have become increasingly important considerations for LPs, reflecting a growing awareness of the non-financial aspects of investments.\n  * **Distributable Net Income (DNI):**  The focus on DNI highlights the importance of understanding how and when returns are generated and distributed to investors.\n\n* **Manager Playbooks:** John emphasizes the importance of understanding a manager's \"playbook\" - their specific strategies and tactics for generating returns.\n  * **Multiple Arbitrage vs. Operational Improvements:** He distinguishes between strategies focused on buying low and selling high (multiple arbitrage) and those that involve actively improving the operations of portfolio companies to drive growth and profitability.\n  * **Focus on Consistent Performers:** HarbourVest seeks managers who can consistently generate attractive returns across different market cycles, not just those who excel in specific environments.\n\n* **Co-investment Insights:** John highlights how HarbourVest's co-investment activities provide valuable insights into the capabilities and decision-making processes of fund managers.\n  * **Alignment of Interests:**  Co-investments allow HarbourVest to observe how managers navigate situations involving multiple investors, particularly in terms of aligning interests and making difficult decisions.\n  * **Identifying True Leaders:** John emphasizes that co-investments provide a \"front-row seat\" to see which managers are actively driving value creation and which ones are simply passive investors.\n\n* **Strategic Advantages of Secondaries:** John discusses the strategic advantages of investing in secondary markets.\n  * **Early Performance and Liquidity:** Secondaries offer faster capital deployment, eliminate the J curve, and provide early performance and liquidity compared to primary investments.\n  * **Diversification and Risk Management:** Secondaries allow for broad diversification, reducing risk and enhancing portfolio stability.\n  * **Limitations in Portfolio Construction:**  While secondaries offer diversification benefits, they can limit the LP's ability to precisely construct a portfolio aligned with specific investment objectives.\n\n* **Growth of the Secondary Market:** John observes the significant growth and evolution of the secondary market.\n  * **Shift from Distressed Sellers to GP-led Transactions:**  He notes a shift from a market dominated by distressed sellers to a more mature market where GP-led transactions have become increasingly prevalent.\n  * **New Opportunities and Investor Base:**  This evolution has expanded the range of investible opportunities and attracted a broader and more sophisticated investor base.\n\n* **Global Investment Perspective:** John outlines HarbourVest's approach to global investments.\n  * **Opportunistic Approach:**  The firm seeks attractive investment opportunities across various markets, adapting its strategies and tactics based on market conditions and local dynamics.\n  * **Focus on Developed Markets:**  Historically, HarbourVest has focused on investments in developed markets, particularly in North America and Europe, where they have a deep understanding and extensive networks.\n  * **Emerging Markets:**  While HarbourVest has made some investments in emerging markets like China and Vietnam, their primary focus remains on developed economies.\n\n* **Learning from Best Practices:** John explains how HarbourVest continuously seeks to improve its operations by learning from the best practices of the private equity firms they invest in.\n  * **Succession Planning:**  He highlights the importance of adopting a stewardship model for succession planning, ensuring a smooth transition of leadership and ownership within the firm.\n  * **Investment Decision-Making:**  John describes how HarbourVest adopted a numerical rating system for investment decisions, inspired by TA Associates, to enhance the rigor and objectivity of their investment process.\n\n* **Challenges of a Global Business:** John acknowledges the increasing complexities and challenges of managing a global business in today's dynamic environment.\n  * **Reliance on Scale and Breadth:**  HarbourVest leverages its scale and breadth of expertise to navigate these complexities and adapt to changing market conditions.\n\n**Overall, Chapter 4 offers a comprehensive view of the LP perspective in private equity investing, emphasizing the importance of data, analytics, manager selection, operational expertise, and continuous improvement.** John's insights into HarbourVest's strategies and practices highlight the sophisticated approach taken by leading LPs to generate attractive returns in this dynamic asset class.\n\n## Chapter 5: The General Partner's Perspective: Sachin Khajuria, Former Partner at Apollo Global Management\n\nThis chapter focuses on the perspective of Sachin Khajuria, a former General Partner (GP) at Apollo Global Management who has transitioned to the role of a Limited Partner (LP). The chapter highlights the key attributes of successful GPs and the advantages of larger firms, while also acknowledging the potential of the mid-market. It emphasizes the importance of public understanding of private equity and provides insights into deal sourcing, valuation, and the evolution of the industry.\n\n### Key Attributes of Successful GPs:\n\n* **Alignment:** This refers to the GP's commitment to their investors and the alignment of interests between the two parties. Successful GPs prioritize long-term value creation and are willing to \"clean up the mess\" even when things get difficult. They demonstrate a strong work ethic and a commitment to delivering results for their investors, going beyond a simple \"buy low, sell high\" mentality.\n* **Knowledge Base:** Leading firms have a wealth of data, experience, and networks, referred to as \"the library,\" that give them an edge. This institutional knowledge is built over time and cannot be easily replicated, providing insights into industries, companies, and market trends.\n* **Temperament:** Successful GPs possess the temperament to navigate market cycles and long-term investments. They can \"pivot when they need to pivot, stick when they need to stick,\" and maintain a long-term perspective focused on achieving desired outcomes.\n\n### Advantages of Larger Firms:\n\n* **Diversification:** Larger firms tend to have a wider range of strategies and expertise, allowing them to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on opportunities in different markets and sectors.\n* **Information Advantage:** Their size allows them to gather more information from various sources, including their different strategies, portfolio companies, and industry networks. This gives them a better understanding of market trends, potential risks, and investment opportunities.\n* **Scale:** They have the resources to handle larger, more complex deals, putting them in a unique position to compete for and acquire high-value assets.\n\n### The Mid-Market:\n\nWhile acknowledging the advantages of larger firms, Khajuria also recognizes the potential of the mid-market. He argues that success in the mid-market hinges on the quality of the people and their ability to adapt to changing market environments. Historically, smaller market segments have yielded attractive returns due to being \"less heavily mined\". Scaling up or down in size is feasible with the right team and expertise.\n\n### Public Understanding of Private Equity:\n\nKhajuria emphasizes the need for greater public understanding of private equity. He argues that this is crucial for improving the industry's public image and making it more accessible to a broader range of investors. Increased awareness would benefit both investors and the industry by \"lowering the noise\" and fostering greater transparency.\n\n### Deal Sourcing:\n\nWhile the term \"proprietary deal\" is frequently used, Khajuria points out that it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain exclusivity in large transactions. Sellers often have obligations to their stakeholders, necessitating engagement with investment banks and potentially multiple bidders. While complete secrecy may be challenging, building relationships and proactively seeking opportunities can give firms a competitive edge.\n\n### Valuation:\n\nKhajuria acknowledges that valuations have increased across the board in private equity. This makes it even more important for firms to be disciplined in their approach and to avoid overpaying for assets. He suggests focusing on businesses with strong fundamentals, growth potential, and cash flow generation to justify higher valuations and deliver attractive returns.\n\n### Evolution of Private Equity:\n\nKhajuria notes that private equity has evolved significantly, with the industry becoming much larger and more sophisticated. The increasing complexity and scale of deals require GPs to be more strategic in their approach, leveraging their expertise, resources, and networks to create value for their investors.\n\nThis chapter emphasizes the importance of alignment, knowledge, and temperament as key attributes of successful GPs. While highlighting the advantages of larger firms, it acknowledges the potential of the mid-market and stresses the need for greater public understanding of private equity. The chapter offers valuable insights into the world of private equity from the perspective of a seasoned professional who has experienced both sides of the industry.\n\n## Chapter 6: The Perfect Buyout: CHI Overhead Doors by KKR\n\nThis chapter focuses on KKR's acquisition of CHI Overhead Doors, highlighting the characteristics of an ideal private equity target and the strategies employed to enhance value during ownership.\n\n### An Ideal Target\n\nThe chapter begins by outlining the traits of a business that make it an attractive target for private equity acquisition. These include:\n\n* **Strong Free Cash Flow Generation:** This provides financial flexibility and the ability to service debt.\n* **Consistent and Growing Revenue:**  Demonstrates market demand and the potential for future expansion.\n* **Resilience to Economic Cycles:**  Ensures stability and minimizes risk during downturns.\n* **Pricing Power:** Allows the company to maintain profitability even with rising costs.\n* **Diverse Customer Base:** Reduces reliance on any single customer and mitigates risk.\n* **Efficient Cost Structure:**  Provides opportunities for further optimization and margin expansion.\n* **Strong Management Team:**  Ensures effective execution of the business plan.\n\n### CHI Overhead Doors: A Case Study\n\nCHI Overhead Doors exemplifies many of these ideal characteristics.

Plant closures and staffing shortages impacted operations. However, the company recovered strongly, regaining its momentum and exceeding its pre-pandemic performance.\n\n### Exit Strategy\n\nKKR's exit strategy for CHI Overhead Doors aligned with its general philosophy of selling when 80% of the planned value creation had been achieved and market conditions were favorable. The sale multiple didn't increase significantly, but the return on investment was exceptional due to operational improvements and the impact of employee ownership.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\nThe CHI Overhead Doors case study illustrates the power of combining a disciplined acquisition strategy with a comprehensive value creation plan. KKR's approach highlights the importance of:\n\n* **Identifying High-Quality Businesses:**  Target companies with strong fundamentals and potential for growth.\n* **Preemptive Dealmaking:** Secure attractive deals before competition drives up prices.\n* **Operational Expertise:**  Leverage internal and external resources to optimize operations and drive efficiency.\n* **Employee Engagement:**  Align incentives and foster ownership to motivate employees and maximize performance.\n\nIt's worth noting that this chapter presents a single case study and might not represent the full range of private equity strategies or the challenges associated with them.\n\n## Chapter 7: Everyone Wins - Parts Town by Berkshire Partners\n\nThis chapter focuses on **Berkshire Partnersâ€™ acquisition of Parts Town**, highlighting a more collaborative and relationship-focused approach to private equity, contrasting the negative stereotypes often associated with the industry.\n\n### Berkshire Partners\n\n* Based in Boston and manages **$20 billion**\n* Known for its collaborative culture and responsible investing approach\n* Values **long-term relationships**, with nearly three-quarters of its deals involving the seller rolling equity into the ownership structure during Berkshire's ownership period\n\n### Parts Town\n\n* A distributor of replacement parts for restaurants\n* Exemplifies characteristics of a **strong business**:\n  * Supplies 150,000 essential but individually low-cost parts, diversifying its revenue stream\n  * Consistent revenue growth for almost 20 years until the COVID-19 pandemic\n\n### Deal Background\n\n* Berkshire Partners had **prior knowledge of the industry** through due diligence on related businesses\n* Identified Parts Town as a **top performer** in the industry\n* Berkshire Partners cultivated a relationship with Parts Town's management team, exploring acquisition opportunities together\n* When the prior owner (Summit Partners) decided to sell, Berkshire **preempted the deal process**\n* This demonstrates Berkshire's proactive approach and the value of building relationships.\n\n### Deal Dynamics\n\n* The deal was preempted at a **15x EBITDA multiple**, considered aggressive at the time\n* Summit Partners **rolled over some of its equity**, indicating a positive outlook for the business and confidence in Berkshire Partners\n* Both Berkshire and Parts Town had **strong values-based cultures**, facilitating a smooth partnership\n\n### Value Creation\n\n* Parts Town's earnings **grew eightfold** during the first seven years of Berkshireâ€™s ownership\n* Initially driven equally by **organic growth and M\\\u0026A**, later shifting to 60% M\\\u0026A and 40% organic growth\n* Berkshire **supported Parts Town's M\\\u0026A strategy**, providing resources and guidance for larger deals while enabling Parts Town to handle smaller tuck-in acquisitions independently\n* They also focused on **operational improvements**, with Berkshire providing resources and guidance while allowing Parts Town to maintain ownership and accountability\n* This highlights Berkshire's collaborative approach, empowering Parts Town to leverage its expertise while providing support and resources.\n\n### Recapitalization\n\n* After five and a half years, Berkshire conducted a **recapitalization**, providing liquidity to the older fund and allowing management to participate while remaining invested\n* This unusual move reflected Berkshire's **long-term view** and desire to continue the partnership\n* The recapitalization process involved a competitive process, ultimately leading to a new ownership structure including Leonard Green Partners and Roark Capital\n* The new investors brought relevant experience, and the transition was marked by transparency and collaboration, with open dialogue about goals and concerns\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n* **Preparation and Relationships:** Berkshire Partners' prior industry knowledge and existing relationship with Parts Town enabled them to act quickly and secure a favorable deal.\n* **Collaborative Approach:** Berkshire Partners worked closely with Parts Town's management team, providing support and resources while respecting their expertise and autonomy.\n* **Long-Term Perspective:** The recapitalization demonstrated Berkshire Partners' commitment to the long-term success of Parts Town and its management team.\n* **Shared Values:** The alignment of values between Berkshire Partners and Parts Town contributed to a strong partnership.\n* **Finding the \"Winners\":** The chapter emphasizes the importance of identifying companies with strong leadership, market position, and capabilities, recognizing that their potential may exceed initial projections.\n\n### Chapter 7 in Context\n\nChapter 7 stands in contrast to the previous chapter, which focused on KKR's acquisition of CHI Overhead Doors.

It focuses on the complexities and strategic considerations involved in corporate carveouts, highlighting the risks and opportunities associated with this type of private equity deal.\n\n### Corporate Carveouts: A Unique Opportunity\n\nThe chapter starts by explaining the nature of corporate carveouts, where a parent company decides to sell a business unit that no longer aligns with its core strategy.  These carveouts present attractive opportunities for private equity firms for several reasons:\n\n* **Undervalued Assets:**  Often, these divested units haven't received sufficient attention or investment from the parent company, leading to untapped potential for improvement and growth.\n* **Motivated Sellers:**  Corporations looking to divest are usually more focused on streamlining their operations and may prioritize a swift transaction over maximizing the sale price. This can provide private equity buyers with a favorable entry valuation.\n* **Transformation Potential:**  By separating from the larger corporate structure, carveouts gain the flexibility to implement strategic changes, improve operational efficiency, and pursue focused growth strategies.\n\n### Risks and Challenges\n\nDespite the strategic appeal, corporate carveouts come with inherent risks and challenges:\n\n* **Complex Separation Process:**  Untangling the carved-out unit from the parent company involves numerous intricate steps, including negotiating transition services agreements, establishing independent infrastructure, and transferring essential functions like IT, finance, and human resources.\n* **Operational Disruptions:**  The transition period can create disruptions to the business, requiring careful planning and execution to minimize any negative impact on operations and customer relationships.\n* **Financing Hurdles:**  Without standalone financial statements, securing debt financing for a carveout can be difficult. Sellers may need to provide financing through seller notes to bridge the gap.\n\n### Orveon: A Complex Carveout\n\nThe case of Orveon highlights the intricacies of a corporate carveout. Advent International acquired three beauty brands â€“ bareMinerals, Laura Mercier, and Buxom â€“ from the Japanese conglomerate Shiseido. Advent initiated the deal during the pandemic, a time when the beauty industry was significantly impacted, with sales of these brands almost at a standstill.\n\nThe negotiations and separation process were complex, requiring agreements on various aspects:\n\n* **Intellectual Property:**  Ensuring clear ownership of brand trademarks and patents.\n* **Contracts:**  Transferring or renegotiating supplier and customer contracts for the new entity.\n* **Manufacturing:**  Establishing independent manufacturing processes or securing agreements with Shiseido for a transition period.\n* **R\\\u0026D:**  Determining the ownership and future development of products in the pipeline.\n* **Financial Infrastructure:**  Setting up independent financial systems and processes.\n* **Digital Infrastructure:**  Migrating or creating websites, social media accounts, and other digital assets.\n* **Data:**  Negotiating access and ownership of customer and operational data.\n* **Personnel:**  Transferring or hiring employees to staff the new organization.\n\n### Advent's Approach\n\nAdvent International brought its extensive experience in corporate carveouts and a commitment to transforming businesses to the Orveon deal. The firm implemented a multi-faceted strategy:\n\n* **Experienced Leadership:**  Recruiting a seasoned CEO, Pascal Houdayer, with a proven track record in the beauty industry and experience in acquisitions and brand management.\n* **Rapid Team Building:** Assembling a complete senior executive team within eight months of acquiring the business.\n* **Incentive Alignment:** Implementing incentive plans that required personal investment from the executive team, fostering ownership and commitment.\n* **Operational Support:**  Leveraging Advent's internal portfolio support group and operations advisors to guide the new management team in establishing essential business functions, including IT, finance, HR, supply chain, and procurement.\n* **Digital Transformation:**  Developing and implementing a nine-part digital value creation plan, including enlisting an Advent employee as the interim head of digital.\n* **Cultural Transformation:**  Defining Orveon's unique values and establishing a distinct culture for the newly independent company.\n\n### Financing the Deal\n\nGiven the lack of independent financial data, Advent secured financing for Orveon through a seller note from Shiseido, avoiding the need for external debt in the initial stages. This provided flexibility for operational improvements and minimized financial pressure during the crucial transition period.\n\n### Looking Ahead\n\nThe successful execution of the Orveon carveout involves ongoing efforts to:\n\n* **Stabilize Operations:** Addressing supply chain challenges and navigating inflationary pressures impacting the cost of goods.\n* **Drive Growth:** Implementing strategic initiatives to expand the brands' market presence and capture growth opportunities.\n* **Build a Strong Foundation:**  Establishing a robust organizational structure, culture, and operational processes to support long-term success.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\nThe Orveon case study provides valuable insights into the dynamics of corporate carveouts, showcasing:\n\n* **The Importance of Preparation:** Thorough due diligence, comprehensive planning, and proactive engagement with stakeholders are crucial for navigating the complexities of carveouts.\n* **The Power of Partnerships:**  Building strong relationships with the seller and key partners is essential for a smooth transition and ongoing support.\n* **The Value of Expertise:**  Leveraging a network of experts and advisors can provide valuable guidance and accelerate the implementation of critical initiatives.\n* **The Benefits of Patience:**  Carveouts require a long-term perspective, recognizing that transforming the business and unlocking its full potential takes time and sustained effort.\n\nThis chapter emphasizes the need for a disciplined approach, operational expertise, and a strong commitment to transformation to succeed in corporate carveouts.

It also highlights the importance of patience, conviction, and a willingness to go against prevailing market sentiment to capitalize on overlooked opportunities.\n\n## Chapter 14: Hustle Amid Complexity - BlueTriton Brands by One Rock Capital Partners\n\nThis chapter explores One Rock Capital Partners' acquisition of BlueTriton Brands from NestlÃ©.

Permanent Equity distinguishes itself through its \"permanent capital\" model, which eschews the traditional private equity model of fixed-term funds in favor of holding businesses indefinitely.\n\n### Permanent Equity's Differentiators:\n\n* **Permanent Capital:** Unlike traditional private equity firms, Permanent Equity does not operate under a fixed-term fund structure. Instead, it invests capital from its balance sheet, allowing it to hold businesses indefinitely and eliminating the pressure to exit investments within a predetermined timeframe. This approach provides flexibility and stability, enabling the firm to make long-term decisions that align with the best interests of the businesses it acquires.\n\n* **Focus on Owner Earnings:**  Permanent Equity prioritizes companies with strong and sustainable owner earnings, which represent the true discretionary cash flow available to the business owner after accounting for essential capital expenditures. This focus ensures that acquired companies have a solid foundation for growth and can generate consistent cash flow to support their operations and expansion plans.\n\n### Selective Search: An Acquisition in the SME Landscape\n\n* **Company Overview:** Selective Search is a retained executive search firm specializing in recruiting senior executives across various industries.  The company operates with a strong reputation for quality and personalized service, making it an attractive target for Permanent Equity's investment philosophy.\n\n* **Acquisition Rationale:** Permanent Equity saw Selective Search as a good fit for its permanent capital model due to the company's consistent profitability, strong management team, and potential for long-term growth. The acquisition aligned with Permanent Equity's strategy of acquiring businesses with stable earnings, a strong market position, and a capable leadership team.\n\n### Value Creation Strategies:\n\n* **Professionalization and Specialization:** Permanent Equity focuses on helping acquired businesses improve their operational efficiency and professionalism. This includes streamlining roles and responsibilities, bringing in specialized talent to manage specific areas of the business, upgrading systems and processes, and establishing robust banking relationships.\n\n* **Growth Support:** While Permanent Equity does not seek to impose drastic changes or disrupt existing operations, it actively supports growth initiatives through strategic investments, talent acquisition, and expansion into new markets or service offerings. The firm's long-term perspective allows it to patiently invest in growth opportunities that may take time to materialize.\n\n* **Financial Flexibility:** The permanent capital model provides financial flexibility, enabling Permanent Equity to act as an internal source of debt financing for its portfolio companies. This eliminates reliance on external lenders and allows the firm to tailor financing terms to the specific needs of the business, as demonstrated by the example of deferring interest payments and repayments during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n### Chapter 17 Key Takeaways:\n\nThis chapter provides insights into:\n\n* **The potential of investing in SMEs:**  While large-scale private equity deals garner significant attention, the vast universe of SMEs presents compelling investment opportunities, particularly for firms with a long-term perspective and a focus on sustainable owner earnings.\n\n* **The benefits of the permanent capital model:**  Permanent Equity's permanent capital approach allows for greater flexibility, stability, and alignment with the long-term interests of the businesses it acquires. This model provides advantages in terms of financial flexibility, growth support, and long-term value creation.\n\n* **The importance of operational improvements and growth support:**  While Permanent Equity does not pursue aggressive cost-cutting or financial engineering strategies, it recognizes the importance of operational efficiency and professionalization in driving sustainable growth.\n\nBy showcasing Permanent Equity's acquisition of Selective Search, Chapter 17 highlights a differentiated approach to private equity investing that emphasizes patient capital, operational excellence, and alignment with the long-term goals of the businesses it owns.\n\n# Individuals Mentioned in \"Private Equity Deals\" and Their Titles/Roles:\n\n* **Ted Seides:** Author of the book *Private Equity Deals*.
