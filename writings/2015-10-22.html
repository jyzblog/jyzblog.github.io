Initially, I was skeptical. These “self-help” or “productivity” books all seem like a waste of time. I didn’t need to be motivated, I understood the importance of time and ambitions at an early age. It was not until a few years later that I realized how much impact this book had on my life and shaped the way I think.</p>
<p>I was just starting my professional career then, and just beginning to understand the money/time tradeoff. The prospect of a “muse” or passive income business immediately caught my eyes. There’s a way to get out of the infinite cycle of trading my time for money? Sign me up! In his book, Tim discussed quite a bit about his experience of replacing himself with a system — an outsourced system, consisted of people overseas who are significantly cheaper in labor cost. Outsourcing was not a new concept, however, this was personalized, customized, revolving around one person’s needs.</p>
<p>As my consulting business started to take off a few years later, I couldn’t wait to start creating my own “outsourced self.” Initially, I followed Tim’s methods. However, as an engineer, my obsession for efficiency and my natural curiocity gradually took over and I ended up with my own set of ways. In this part of the post, I’ll discuss my experiments with Tim’s teachings and lessons learned:</p>
<h3>Tim’s Method 1: Outsource Busywork</h3>
<p>For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant">virtual assistants</a> (VAs), I experimented with a few elance-like services. At the time, the price ranged from $3-15 usd/hr . I interviewed about half a dozen of VAs and negotiated a deal with a lady from the Philippines for $30/week. She ended up being a great asset for me, mainly for placing a lot of outbound phone calls. I set up a VPN in the states on an old laptop and she was able to use a google voice number to call for free.</p>
<p>However, as time went on, I realized a few things I dislike about this setup:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have <strong>less and less of work</strong> for her to do. I realized I couldn’t trust her with the more sensitive information of my business, which prevented her from being too effective. I tried time-sharing her time with another contractor friend of mine, but even that couldn’t keep her busy.</li>
<li><strong>Lot of instructions required</strong>. Sometimes, the time cost of writing up a clear set of instructions simply doesn’t make sense. I ended up doing lots of the busywork myself.</li>
<li><strong>Upfront time cost</strong>. Like any other hiring decision, usually it costs quite a bit of time and energy to do the initial digging.</li>
<li><strong>Virtualness means far.</strong> In practice, a lot of the assistance work I needed required physical proximity. For example, I found myself needing/using taskrabbit or food delivery services way more when they became available in SF.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Tim’s Method 2: Outsource Research</h3>
<p>For consulting businesses to survive, lead generation is critical. You have to maintain a constant stream of clients, then you can start to expand.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sourcing via Linkedin</strong>. Linkedin is the center for professionals on the interwebs these days. I had my VA look through some of the less tapped industries and gather important decision makers’ information onto a spreadsheet/csv file. Since <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">software is eating the world</a>, any industry can use my service. I’d rather explore industries with less exposure to tech.</li>
<li><strong>Résumé’ing on all hiring websites</strong>. This is pretty straightforward: my VA helped me fill in job applications.. everywhere.</li>
<li><strong>Interfacing with recruiters</strong>. Recruiters have a bad rep in tech due to high placement fees and constant phone/email harassments. I came up with an alternative fee structure and my VA helped me turned the table and spammed lots of recruiters.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the time, I also wanted to explore real estate as an alternative passive income opportunity. Lots of the research and analysis in housing prices, buy/rent ratio, cost of living, and quality of living in different LoI (locations of interest) were done by my capable VA.</p>
<h3>Tim’s Method 3: Outsource Actual Work</h3>
<p>It’s been a while since I read the ‘4 hour workweek,’ but I believe there was a whole chapter in his book about how the chapter was actually written by people overseas. For my software consulting business, however, I’ve always been against outsourcing. I think we are in an industry where reputation and quality of work matter way more, I almost always get better clients from word-of-mouth referrals than cold calling. The only tasks I used my VA for were general communications and customer on/off boarding (schedule meetings, receive feedback etc.).</p>
<h3>Additional thoughts</h3>
<p>Even though Tim Ferriss’ outsourcing approach is a great life/productivity hack, there are quite a few downsides. The problem with humans in general is that they are harder to manage. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less predictable: people move on to other jobs and they get sick. As an employer, you have to constantly have a backup in mind.</li>
<li>Requires repetitive training: depends on the person, you have to invest a lot of time training and correcting your employee(s). With every new person that comes in/leaves, you have to start the process all over again.</li>
<li>High upfront cost: both in terms of training (onboarding) and opportunity cost (possible better candidates in the future)</li>
<li>Domain expertise: sometimes, the jobs are simply too technical that it’s impossible to prepare someone in a short period of time.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why I believe computer-driven automation is the natural sequel to Tim’s human-powered automation. It’s cheaper, more reliable, more scalable, and to an engineer’s perspective, more adaptable.</p>
<p>In the next part of this post, I will discuss my modified system, a completely computerized system, that currently runs &gt;80% of my life. I will discuss the technology stack I personally use as well as the cost analysis in terms of time and money I spend maintaining my servers and writing code.</p></article></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"content":"# From Outsourcing Your Life to Full Automation\n*October 21, 2015*\n\u003cp\u003eLike many others, My Tim Ferriss obsession started after his book ‘The 4-hour Work Week’ came out in 2007.
