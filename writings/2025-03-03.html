<p><em>March 2, 2025</em></p>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday, June 12, 1984.</p>
<p>Gary Halbert begins a series of letters to his son, Bond, aiming to share crucial lessons learned over 46 years on topics such as <strong>selling by mail, health, interpersonal relationships, and general life wisdom</strong>, even hinting at &quot;sex, drugs and rock and roll!&quot;. He plans to write for about an hour daily, except Sundays, and intends to use these letters as source material for a future book, possibly titled &quot;How To Be Your Own Messiah&quot;. He notes that the letters will &quot;ramble around somewhat&quot; as he prioritizes flow over precise editing.</p>
<p>On his birthday, Gary feels good because he was able to run &quot;the hill&quot; non-stop for the first time, a steep 8/10 of a mile route. Just three weeks prior, he could barely walk it once, and now aims to run it ten times (8 miles) without stopping.</p>
<p>The <strong>&quot;first and most important thing&quot;</strong> he addresses is <strong>improving and maintaining health and physical fitness</strong>. He strongly recommends an hour of daily &quot;road work&quot; (walking, jogging, running) six days a week, ideally right after waking up. He suggests a morning routine of washing up, eating a piece of fruit (preferably a banana), and then immediately heading out for about 30 minutes out and back. The benefits are enormous: it &quot;cleans you out,&quot; &quot;settles you down,&quot; provides a &quot;nice glow,&quot; makes you &quot;more clearheaded,&quot; and improves thinking. He believes this practice will lead to a &quot;positive addiction&quot;.</p>
<p>This <strong>positive addiction</strong> is described as a real, physiological phenomenon: after about 40 minutes of road work, the brain secretes &quot;survival chemicals&quot; like <strong>beta endorphins and norepinephrine</strong>, which some claim are 200 times stronger than morphine. This creates a beneficial &quot;high&quot; that is natural and makes you &quot;zestful rather than speedy,&quot; unlike artificial drug highs. He emphasizes this as &quot;very close to being the most important thing of all&quot; he has learned. Gary asks Bond to get &quot;The Joy of Running&quot; by Theodore Kostrubala.</p>
<p><strong>Insights from Bond (Postscript):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This first letter is often overlooked but clearly emphasizes health, a topic Gary prioritized because his own father died at 59 of heart failure.</li>
<li>Gary, despite being hard on his body previously, lived ten years longer than his father, confirmed by the medical examiner who noted he was in &quot;great shape&quot; except for a hereditary blocked artery.</li>
<li>Bond personally found jogging difficult due to knee issues and the time it took to feel endorphins, preferring non-competitive sports like bicycling.</li>
<li><strong>Hidden Lesson: Try Things At Least Twice.</strong> Both Gary&#x27;s progress on the hill and Bond&#x27;s bicycling experience illustrate that <strong>first attempts are often &quot;sloppy and lame&quot; and may fail, but a second attempt provides crucial learning and makes the task &quot;much easier&quot;</strong>. This applies to all of life and is a key differentiator for success, as most people quit after a poor first experience.</li>
<li><strong>Hidden Lesson: Stephen Covey&#x27;s Four Square Lesson on Life (Time Management).</strong> Getting up early for road work relates to the concept of categorizing activities into four quadrants:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Q1: Urgent &amp; Important</strong> (e.g., fixing a broken arm).</li>
<li><strong>Q2: Important &amp; Not Urgent</strong> (e.g., working out, prostate exam). <strong>Winners and successful people spend significantly more time in Q2</strong>. Doing Q2 tasks proactively helps avoid them becoming urgent Q1 problems later.</li>
<li><strong>Q3: Urgent &amp; Not Important</strong> (e.g., getting to a store before it closes).</li>
<li><strong>Q4: Not Urgent &amp; Not Important</strong> (e.g., reading a classic novel).
Gary emphasizes doing important things early in the morning before the day&#x27;s urgent demands (emails, calls) consume your time. This applies to business as well, such as testing marketing campaigns or writing copy. He suggests <strong>90% of successful people get up early (or stay up late) to work uninterrupted</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Wednesday, June 13, 1984.</p>
<p>Gary mentions developing a new &quot;get tough&quot; attitude after a negative meeting. He again stresses the immense value of <strong>road work as the &quot;number one most valuable habit,&quot;</strong> stating it improves the entire day by draining tension and anxiety, and clearing the mind for better thinking.</p>
<p>He introduces <strong>fasting</strong> as another important health habit, recommending Bond (despite his youth) fast one full day each week. Gary fasts every Saturday and plans to continue for life, noting benefits like normalizing body functions and developing self-discipline. <strong>Tips for fasting:</strong> do not tell others about it due to their &quot;ignorant babble,&quot; and avoid strenuous athletic exercise on fast days to allow for physical and mental rest. Gary uses his fast days for reading, puttering, and small chores. He equates road work to &quot;ordering your day&quot; and fasting to &quot;<strong>ordering your week</strong>&quot;. He considers these two things the most important lessons he&#x27;s ever learned.</p>
<p>Regarding diet, Gary states breakfast is <em>not</em> the most important meal; he recommends only a couple of pieces of fruit before lunch, with one (preferably a banana) before road work. He suggests eating <strong>three pieces of fruit daily</strong> (banana, apple, or orange) for nutrients and bowel health, calling fruit &quot;the prize food of man&quot; and a necessary food for Americans. He also recommends a <strong>big bowl of &quot;bran type&quot; cereal</strong> (like Grapenuts) and a large glass of <strong>non-fat milk</strong> daily, plus at least one serving of <strong>lean meat or fowl</strong>. He cautions to limit eggs due to cholesterol. He also suggests <strong>protein powder as &quot;protein insurance&quot;</strong> for growing boys. He encourages flexibility in diet after healthy eating, advising common sense over strict prohibitions against treats like ice cream.</p>
<p>Gary expresses a desire to start a &quot;Halbert Tradition&quot; where fathers pass down what they&#x27;ve learned to the next generation. He also recommends &quot;The Miracle of Fasting&quot; by Paul Bragg and &quot;Are You Confused?&quot; by Paulo Airola. He reassures Bond not to feel pressured to write back as much as he does.</p>
<p>He recounts a story about &quot;Crackers,&quot; an &quot;arrogant&quot; tomcat at the camp who torments small animals. This anecdote leads to the powerful quote Gary read: <strong>&quot;There is no justice. There is only power.&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Insights from Bond (Postscript):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bond clarifies Gary was always tough, not just &quot;getting tough&quot; now, having overcome significant life challenges. Gary&#x27;s toughness surfaced particularly against &quot;mean people&quot; and cruelty. This mental toughness was a vital &quot;survival skill&quot; and &quot;mental armor&quot;.</li>
<li>While Bond tried fasting, he found it unpleasant. He affirms Gary&#x27;s nutritional advice, noting Gary was in great physical condition at his death, despite his hereditary heart issues.</li>
<li><strong>Most Overlooked Lesson: &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Anyone.&quot;</strong> Gary&#x27;s advice not to tell others about fasting carries a deeper meaning derived from his favorite saying: <strong>&quot;nothing is impossible for a man who refuses to listen to reason&quot;</strong>. Most people are &quot;nay sayers&quot; who will discourage grand ambitions. It&#x27;s often better to <strong>&quot;just silently go about proving or accomplishing your goal&quot;</strong> without arguing, like the doctor who proved ulcers were caused by organisms despite widespread disbelief.</li>
<li>Gary&#x27;s desire to pass down wisdom inspired Bond to write letters to his own children.</li>
<li>The &quot;Crackers&quot; story and the &quot;no justice, only power&quot; quote resonated with Gary due to his own experiences of being wealthy and broke multiple times, and being in prison for a crime he felt he didn&#x27;t commit. Bond notes Gary&#x27;s ability to &quot;move on&quot; from difficult situations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Thursday, June 14, 1984.</p>
<p>Gary reports continued progress on &quot;The Hill,&quot; jogging it twice non-stop, feeling &quot;lean and mean&quot;. He reviews his prior health recommendations: daily road work, three pieces of fruit, and a large bowl of bran cereal.</p>
<p>He expands on diet, advising a <strong>lot of vegetables</strong>, suggesting Bond cut them up nightly and carry them for snacking throughout the day. He refutes the idea of not eating between meals, recommending <strong>six small meals instead of three big ones</strong>, or simply nibbling when hungry to maintain constant blood sugar and avoid tiredness.</p>
<p>A crucial lesson is emphasized: <strong>do not depend on others to prepare your food or help you stay healthy</strong>. Gary stresses developing a <strong>&quot;tough independent attitude&quot;</strong> to avoid making excuses for failure by relying on others. He reiterates the importance of daily non-fat milk, lean meat/fowl, limited eggs, and adding bran flakes and protein powder to the diet. He adds that if you consistently do road work and eat well, you won&#x27;t have much room or desire for junk food.</p>
<p>Gary outlines his ambitious <strong>11-month plan for writing his book</strong>, starting with 3 months for the letters to Bond, then collecting notes, outlining, and drafting. He sees prison as &quot;the best place to write and get healthy I&#x27;ve ever been&quot;.</p>
<p>He advises Bond to focus on <strong>developing strong, muscular arms</strong> through presses and curls, but cautions against an &quot;exaggerated body builder&#x27;s body,&quot; which he believes women are generally not attracted to. He prefers a &quot;lean and hard&quot; physique. The reasons for arm development are practicality (strength), attractiveness to women, and crucially, in prison, <strong>&quot;just having big arms can keep you out of a lot of trouble&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Insights from Bond (Postscript):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bond agrees with Gary&#x27;s health and workout advice.</li>
<li><strong>The &quot;Don&#x27;t Rely on Anyone&quot; Lesson (Financial Context).</strong> This expands on the previous chapter&#x27;s theme of self-reliance, particularly in the context of making money. Bond explains that friends and family often react negatively to ambitious financial plans, not consciously, but because your potential success makes them question their own choices. There is an &quot;irrational hatred of the rich&quot;. Therefore, it is <strong>&quot;vital that you never let the bastards get you down,&quot;</strong> and to surround yourself with supportive people or those who are already successful. A support system requires actively weeding out negative influences, like a garden.</li>
<li><strong>Intentional Repetition.</strong> Bond highlights that Gary&#x27;s frequent repetition is <strong>&quot;100% intentional&quot;</strong>. This is a business lesson akin to the Godfather&#x27;s advice to review plans repeatedly to avoid carelessness. <strong>Winners constantly revise and reassess their plans</strong>.</li>
<li>The two key lessons from this chapter are: 1) the great advantage of <strong>shutting out the negative attitudes of the masses</strong>, and 2) <strong>winners revise their plans over and over and constantly reassess</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Friday, June 15, 1984.</p>
<p>Gary expresses gratitude for his family&#x27;s visit and their role as a &quot;strong outside &#x27;support system&#x27;&quot;. He explains his need to leave early due to commissary (for fruit) and to spend time with a friend who was leaving, illustrating his prioritization.</p>
<p>He revisits the ideal male physique: <strong>lean and hard with strong muscular arms, but not a &quot;bulging, exaggerated weight-lifter&#x27;s body&quot;</strong>. He expands on the reasons for arm development: practical strength, attraction to women, and gaining respect from men. He asserts that a <strong>&quot;fat, sloppy or skinny and weak body tends to broadcast... lacking self-respect&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>A profound lesson is introduced: <strong>&quot;DEFENSIVE BEHAVIOR INVITES AGGRESSIVE ACTION!&quot;</strong>. In life, and especially in prison, there is little sympathy for weakness. He illustrates this with an inmate who acts perpetually scared and subservient, sending out signals like <strong>&quot;I&#x27;m scared. I&#x27;m a pussy. I&#x27;m easy. I&#x27;m vulnerable.&quot;</strong>. This behavior irritates Gary and attracts predators.</p>
<p>The core message emerges: it is <strong>&quot;far better to: Rely On Your Own Strength Instead Of Somebody Else&#x27;s Compassion!&quot;</strong>. He clarifies that this means <em>being</em> tough, not just acting tough or being mean. Predators choose easy targets. When one &quot;gets tough,&quot; their entire demeanor changes – appearance, movement, reactions, and overall &quot;signals&quot;. He echoes John D. Rockefeller that nothing is as satisfying as self-reliance. Developing strong arms, he notes, is a practical way to <strong>&quot;avoid fights without losing your dignity,&quot;</strong> as it sends a deterrent signal (&quot;Damn! Look at the arms on that guy!&quot;).</p>
<p>Assuming Bond is now committed to health, Gary declares he will temporarily shift focus to <strong>how to make money</strong>, returning to health and fitness later. He concludes with anecdotes about other inmates, including a heroin dealer and a man who blinded a snitch, highlighting the harsh realities of prison life and individual &quot;ways&quot; of dealing with it.</p>
<p><strong>Insights from Bond (Postscript):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bond confirms Gary&#x27;s excellent prioritization, beginning his letters with health before moving to his unique lessons.</li>
<li>Gary possessed a rare and enviable ability to <strong>&quot;eradicat[e] people from his life if they were not a positive influence,&quot;</strong> even family, to maintain a positive support system. Bond emphasizes that the &quot;real trick is to cut out those that hold you back&quot;. This is likened to a garden where you must constantly pull weeds.</li>
<li>In business, Gary always sought to appear strong, which meant carrying himself with confidence.</li>
<li>The Rockefeller quote reinforces that <strong>self-reliance is often the true motive of great businessmen, more so than money</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Saturday, June 16, 1984.</p>
<p>Gary delves into the subject of making money, declaring the #1 big secret: <strong>get involved in whatever excites you most.</strong> He states, &quot;<strong>Money, in my opinion, especially big money, is most often a by product of enthusiasm.</strong>&quot;. He advises to hire the most enthusiastic person, not necessarily the most qualified, as <strong>attitude is paramount</strong>.</p>
<p>He then transitions to direct marketing, stressing that the very first and most important thing to realize is that you <strong>must become a &quot;student of markets,&quot;</strong> not products, techniques, or copywriting. The way to deduce what people want to buy is to <strong>&quot;simply observe what they DO buy!&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>Gary illustrates the crucial distinction between what people <em>say</em> they buy and what they <em>actually do</em> with examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>A beer company survey showed customers preferred premium beer, yet sales data showed they bought regular beer. People often give the &quot;right&quot; answer they <em>should</em> drink.</li>
<li>Despite almost everyone putting down &quot;The National Enquirer,&quot; it is the <strong>largest selling newspaper in the world &quot;BY FAR!&quot;</strong>.</li>
<li>Many claim the Bible is their most read book, yet &quot;damn-few people have actually READ the Bible&quot;. Gary provocatively states: <strong>&quot;MORE PEOPLE READ THE &#x27;NATIONAL ENQUIRER&#x27; IN ONE SINGLE WEEK THAN HAVE EVER READ THE BIBLE IN THE LAST 2,000 YEARS!&quot;</strong>.
He concludes that to be a top marketer, you must be a <strong>&quot;student of reality&quot;</strong> – understanding &quot;how it <em>really</em> is&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>To find out what people <em>actually</em> buy via direct response, he recommends using <strong>&quot;The SRDS Direct Mail List Book,&quot;</strong> specifically reading the CONSUMER LISTS section. He advises paying close attention to the <strong>&quot;numbers involved&quot; and &quot;average unit of sale&quot;</strong> (the higher, the better). He gives examples of &quot;Diamond And Ruby Buyers&quot; and &quot;Diamond Buyers And Enquirers&quot; lists, calculating their massive potential sales volume, emphasizing that the &quot;greed glands&quot; will get going.</p>
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Sunday, June 17, 1984.</p>
<p>Gary continues on the theme of being a &quot;student of markets.&quot; He presents his famous <strong>&quot;hamburger stand&quot; analogy</strong>: if competing to sell the most hamburgers, the only advantage he would want is <strong>&quot;A STARVING CROWD!&quot;</strong>. This teaches to constantly seek out <strong>groups of people (markets) who are &quot;starving (or at least hungry!) for some particular product or service&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>He then outlines a progression of mailing list quality for selling an investment book, from worst to best:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Possibility #1: Phone book names:</strong> Terrible due to too many non-prospects and &quot;waste circulation&quot; (like shooting with a shotgun).</li>
<li><strong>Possibility #2: Phone book names from high-income areas:</strong> A little better, but still &quot;not nearly good enough&quot; due to diversity within zip codes and continued waste.</li>
<li><strong>Possibility #3: High-income professionals (doctors, lawyers, etc.):</strong> &quot;Not bad,&quot; as they likely have the <em>ability</em> to invest, but not necessarily the interest.</li>
<li><strong>Possibility #4: Wealthy, proven mail order buyers:</strong> &quot;Getting down to business,&quot; as mail order buyers of <em>anything</em> are generally better than non-buyers.</li>
<li><strong>Possibility #5: Wealthy, mail order buyers of <em>other investment books</em>:</strong> Now &quot;cooking,&quot; as they are wealthy, MO buyers, and have purchased a similar product.</li>
<li><strong>Possibility #6: Wealthy, <em>repeat</em> mail order buyers of similar investment books:</strong> Even &quot;sweeter,&quot; as they are repeat buyers, indicating high desire.</li>
<li><strong>Possibility #7: Wealthy, repeat mail order buyers of similar investment books who paid <em>big money</em>:</strong> &quot;Very close to the &#x27;crème de la crème&#x27;&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Possibility #8: All of #7, <em>and</em> who have <em>recently</em> made such a purchase:</strong> &quot;Almost as good a list as we can get,&quot; and typically the best rentable list.</li>
<li><strong>Possibility #9: All of #8, <em>and</em> a good list broker confirms it&#x27;s working well for other similar mailers:</strong> The true &quot;best list you can mail to&quot; by renting.</li>
<li><strong>Possibility #10: YOUR OWN CUSTOMER LIST!</strong> Assuming they are satisfied customers, this is the best list of all, outperforming any other.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gary then briefly detours into the importance of <strong>client control</strong>, stating he often uses an &quot;iron fist&quot; with clients, as many will try to dictate copy, leading to &quot;miserable failures&quot;. He believes clients are often relieved when the expert (copywriter) takes firm control (&quot;don&#x27;t you dare mess with my copy&quot;). He also stresses structuring deals to get paid <strong>&quot;often,&quot;</strong> because clients struggle to write big checks, especially once they have the ad.</p>
<p>He encapsulates a core principle: <strong>&quot;Sell People What They Want To Buy!&quot;</strong>. He advises observing which ads and direct mail pieces repeatedly appear, as this indicates they &quot;hit a nerve&quot;. The goal is to hit that same nerve, only better. <strong>&quot;All You Have To Do Is Observe!&quot;</strong>.</p>
<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Monday, June 18, 1984.</p>
<p>Continuing on mailing lists, Gary reinforces that proven mail order buyers outperform non-buyers. He introduces the <strong>three main guidelines for selecting lists to test: Recency, Frequency, and Unit of Sale (RFM)</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recency:</strong> <strong>By far the most important.</strong> The more recently a person purchased a similar item by mail, the more receptive they will be. &quot;Hotline buyers&quot; (most recent buyers, e.g., 30-day or 90-day) are &quot;extremely good prospects&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Frequency:</strong> The more often a person buys a particular item, the higher their desire for that product or service type.</li>
<li><strong>Unit of Sale:</strong> A higher price paid for a previous purchase indicates a &quot;hotter prospect&quot; for similar products. He states: <strong>&quot;people don&#x27;t always put their money where their mouths are; but they do nearly always put out their money where their true desires are.&quot;</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>He advises finding &quot;hot&quot; mail order publications by observing where mail order companies advertise repeatedly. He suggests getting copies of the top 100 magazines (from the &quot;Gallagher Report&quot;) to identify those with many mail order ads.</p>
<p>He again emphasizes his philosophy of <strong>client control</strong>, recalling a challenging situation with a client named Z. He asserts that clients often try to micromanage, leading to poor results, and that his &quot;hard headed&quot; approach (a &quot;don&#x27;t you dare mess with my copy&quot; attitude) is why he&#x27;s in such high demand. He also touches on ensuring timely payments by structuring deals to get paid &quot;often,&quot; as clients often struggle to write big checks, especially once the ad is delivered.</p>
<p>Gary reiterates his core marketing rule: <strong>&quot;Sell People What They Want To Buy!&quot;</strong> which is &quot;so obvious, so overlooked and so important&quot;. He once more stresses the importance of <strong>observing repeating ads and direct mail pieces</strong> as indicators of what&#x27;s working (&quot;hitting a nerve&quot;). You don&#x27;t need to guess or survey; <strong>&quot;All You Have To Do Is Observe!&quot;</strong>.</p>
<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday, June 19, 1984.</p>
<p>Gary discusses the choice between working and resting when tired. He differentiates between a &quot;lack of discipline&quot; (halting progress for minor fatigue) and &quot;foolishness&quot; (pushing when chronically tired or sick). His approach: <strong>start working anyway, monitor body signals, and only stop if truly feeling worse; otherwise, &quot;keep on plugging along.&quot;</strong> He quotes, &quot;<strong>Most of the world&#x27;s work is done by people who didn&#x27;t feel much like getting out of bed</strong>&quot;. He also recommends V-8 juice as a healthy, cheap alternative to eating or soft drinks.</p>
<p>He persistently reiterates the importance of <strong>believing in numbers over words</strong> by highlighting human behavior discrepancies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many claim to never buy by mail, yet mail order sales are in the billions. He jokes these are the same people who deny reading &quot;The National Enquirer&quot;.</li>
<li>In a USC class, students claimed to prefer plays over movies, but far more had seen a movie recently than a play.</li>
<li><strong>The truth is determined by how people use their <em>wallet</em>, not their <em>mouth</em>.</strong>. He urges Bond to be skeptical of what people say, surveys, and questionnaires, and instead <strong>&quot;believe in numbers!&quot;</strong>. &quot;If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck - guess what? It&#x27;s probably a duck!&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>He advises staying aware by regularly consulting the SRDS book, monitoring hot mail order publications and ads, getting on mailing lists, and observing offers received. This cultivates a &quot;sixth sense&quot; for overlooked marketing opportunities.</p>
<p>Gary shares his belief that significant money can be made by targeting people at <strong>&quot;emotional turning points&quot;</strong> in their lives (e.g., new baby, marriage, job raise, bankruptcy, new car). He illustrates this by discovering a list of 120,000 new pregnant mothers monthly in SRDS. He outlines a hypothetical promotion for a report titled &quot;How To Raise Your Child&#x27;s IQ Before It Is Even Born!&quot;, calculating a potential profit of <strong>$58,200 EVERY MONTH</strong> from a 5% response rate on 120,000 names, after deducting fulfillment and mailing costs.</p>
<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Wednesday, June 20, 1984.</p>
<p>Gary starts by acknowledging he often writes without a clear direction, trusting that the writing process itself will provide guidance. He reminds Bond that even &quot;less responsive lists,&quot; like names from a phone book, can be valuable, citing his successful &quot;coat-of-arms promotion&quot; as an example.</p>
<p>He discusses <strong>how to think about developing a mail order campaign</strong>, emphasizing continued study of the SRDS list book and mail order advertising. He shares a new idea from reviewing SRDS&#x27;s &quot;compiled lists&quot; (groups with common traits like professions or business types). His idea: take a general headline like &quot;How You Can Make Extra Money&quot; and <strong>customize it for specific groups</strong> (e.g., &quot;How Architects Can Make Extra Money,&quot; &quot;How Chiropractors Can Make Extra Money&quot;). The product would be a report with general money-making techniques and a customized section unique to that group. He even calls chiropractors &quot;greedy&quot; and suggests them as good targets.</p>
<p>He provides an example letter opening for a chiropractor, showing how the <strong>personalized salutation and customized offer (&quot;doctors of chiropractic to make a great deal of extra money&quot;)</strong> immediately grab attention. He calculates the potential profit for such an offer to chiropractors: from a 4% response on 33,000 names, he estimates a <strong>net profit of $9,920.00</strong> after mailing and fulfillment costs.</p>
<p>This profit, while &quot;not a fortune,&quot; represents a <strong>&quot;winning formula&quot;</strong>. The strategy is to keep the general part of the report the same and only customize the last third for different groups, leading to &quot;Mucho bucks!&quot;. He stresses that the <strong>more &quot;custom tailored&quot; your promotion is, the more successful it will be</strong>. He demonstrates this with examples of generic &quot;Dear Occupant&quot; vs. personalized and customized letters (&quot;Dear Bond, Here is a great new way for 16 year old kids to make money!&quot;). He also shows how a general real estate headline (&quot;How To Buy Real Estate With No Money Down&quot;) improves by <strong>customizing it for a specific location</strong> (&quot;How To Buy L.A. Real Estate With No Money Down&quot;), which he confirms worked much better in practice. He concludes that &quot;Ideas breed other ideas,&quot; suggesting even further double customization (e.g., &quot;How a cardiologist can buy L.A. real estate&quot;).</p>
<h3>Chapter 10</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Thursday, June 21, 1984.</p>
<p>Gary starts the letter without a clear plan, noting that his previous day&#x27;s writing also started this way but produced &quot;something excellent&quot;. He emphasizes the lesson: <strong>when feeling stuck or &quot;emotionally jammed up,&quot; the way to get &quot;unclogged and flowing again is just to keep moving.&quot;</strong> This can be physical (running, walking, jogging) or mental (writing, doing chores). <strong>&quot;The key is movement!&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>He assumes Bond is consistently following his health and market research advice and then moves to <strong>how to create an ad or direct mail promotion from scratch</strong>.
He recommends getting and reading two classic marketing books multiple times:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;Scientific Advertising&quot; by Claude Hopkins (3 times)</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;The Robert Collier Letter Book&quot; by Robert Collier (2 times)</strong>.
The first reading is for enjoyment, subsequent readings are for taking notes. Additionally, Bond should read Gary&#x27;s &quot;2001 Headlines&quot; and Ben Suarez&#x27;s &quot;SuperBiz&quot; headlines, and create a &quot;swipe file&quot; of good ads and DM pieces, reading them and taking notes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gary outlines a <strong>5-step process for creating a DM promotion:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Step 1: Find a suitable mailing list</strong> in the SRDS book.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2: Read and take notes from hot books on the chosen topic</strong> (e.g., real estate investing) relevant to the list.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3: Collect and take notes from existing DM pieces and space ads</strong> on the same topic.</li>
<li><strong>Step 4: Review notes from Collier, Hopkins, and headlines.</strong> A &quot;central selling idea&quot; should emerge. This idea should personalize and customize the offer (e.g., how to buy real estate in <em>his area</em> with no money down). He shows an example of a letter opening customized by location (&quot;to buy L.A. real estate,&quot; &quot;to buy Detroit real estate&quot;). He then demonstrates <strong>&quot;double customization&quot;</strong> by targeting both location <em>and</em> occupation (e.g., &quot;How for a cardiologist to buy L.A. real estate&quot;).</li>
<li><strong>Step 5: Create the product.</strong> This involves outlining the best ideas from read books, adding one&#x27;s own ideas, arranging them logically, and writing a report (around 100 typewritten pages). This process, if done properly, creates a valuable &quot;tight informative roadmap&quot;. He even comes up with a working title: &quot;The Amazing L.A. Roadmap To Real Estate Riches!&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Chapter 11</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Friday, June 22, 1984.</p>
<p>Gary focuses on the <strong>creation of a direct mail promotion, starting with the outside envelope</strong>, which he says is where most mailers fail. He explains that most mailers use &quot;teaser copy&quot; and design envelopes that are obviously commercial.</p>
<p>He introduces his <strong>&quot;A-Pile, B-Pile&quot; lecture</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone divides their daily mail into two piles:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>A-Pile:</strong> Contains mail that appears personal (from friends, relatives, business associates). <strong>This mail is <em>always</em> opened</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>B-Pile:</strong> Contains envelopes that are obviously commercial (with company names, bulk rate indicia, teaser copy). B-Pile mail is often thrown away unopened, or set aside and only <em>maybe</em> opened if the recipient is bored or has idle time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The objective is to get your envelope into the &quot;A-Pile&quot;</strong> by making it look personal, or at least non-commercial.</li>
</ul>
<p>He then details the <strong>ideal &quot;A-Pile&quot; envelope design</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Corner card:</strong> Only a return address, <strong>no company name</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Stamp:</strong> Use an <strong>&quot;honest-to-God live 1st class stamp (20¢)&quot;</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Address:</strong> A <strong>handwritten or typed address; no label</strong>.
This design ensures nearly everyone will open it because it&#x27;s intriguing and looks personal. He criticizes that this &quot;obvious&quot; secret is missed by &quot;almost every advertising agency and nearly every so-called &#x27;direct mail expert&#x27;&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, he moves to <strong>getting the potential customer to <em>start</em> reading the sales letter</strong>. He suggests using an &quot;attention grabber&quot; like attaching a <strong>small plastic baggie filled with dirt</strong> to the top of the letter. This physical grabber immediately captures &quot;focused attention,&quot; making the reader curious (&quot;What&#x27;s in this baggie?&quot; &quot;Why dirt?&quot;) and compelling them to read to find out. He also notes the importance of placing the typed day, date, and time above the salutation.</p>
<p><strong>Insights from Bond (Postscript):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is indeed Gary&#x27;s famous A-Pile, B-Pile speech.</li>
<li>Gary <strong>never used &quot;teaser copy&quot;</strong> because it immediately signals &quot;junk mail&quot; (&quot;oh yuck&quot; factor). Instead, he used &quot;First Class&quot; or &quot;Personal&quot; in red ink for higher-priced promotions or when mail screeners were involved, sometimes even using FedEx or a courier.</li>
<li>Gary frequently used physical &quot;grabbers&quot; like coins or betting slips, and Bond inherited Iraqi money intended for this purpose.</li>
<li>Bond notes that at this point, Gary was visibly transforming into a &quot;fit, focused and fearless human being,&quot; nearing his peak performance.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chapter 12</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Saturday, June 23, 1984.</p>
<p>Gary continues discussing the real estate letter, explaining the specific details on the first page. He elaborates on including the <strong>day of the week, exact time, day of the month, and year</strong>. This makes the letter feel more personal, creating a &quot;bond of intimacy and immediacy&quot; between writer and reader, much like a telegram. He also suggests describing your current location and activity (e.g., &quot;sitting cross-legged on my back here in room 7 of dorm 6 in the Boron Federal Prison Camp&quot;) to further strengthen this bond.</p>
<p>He emphasizes the <strong>personalization of the salutation, using the recipient&#x27;s name (&quot;Dear Mr. Jones&quot; or &quot;Dear Bond&quot;)</strong> rather than generic greetings like &quot;Dear Sir&quot; or &quot;Dear Occupant&quot;. This ensures the reader knows the letter is specifically for them, leading to greater attention.</p>
<p>Gary then reveals another small but crucial detail: including tiny instructions like <strong>&quot;(over)&quot; or &quot;(go to page 7)&quot;</strong> in the lower right-hand corner. This &quot;takes the reader by the hand&quot; and guides them through the letter, making it &quot;pleasant, easy-read, interesting and unconfusing,&quot; especially since prospects are often busy or distracted.</p>
<p>He moves on to <strong>reply envelopes</strong>, stating they must be included. He outlines three choices:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>SRE (Stamped Reply Envelope):</strong> Reader pays postage.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Cost (e.g., $200 per thousand at 20¢ stamp).</li>
<li><strong>When to test:</strong> For <strong>high-ticket items</strong> where one or two extra sales cover the stamp cost. Also, to <strong>induce guilt</strong>, especially for charity letters (&quot;...I have even gone to the expense of putting a stamp on it so you won&#x27;t have to hunt for one!&quot;). He explains that getting someone to mentally agree to write &quot;No&quot; can sometimes lead them to order instead, once they have pen and paper in hand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>BRE (Business Reply Envelope):</strong> Mailer pays postage only on returned envelopes.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Convenient for customer, cheaper than SRE.</li>
<li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> <strong>Slows mail/cash flow</strong> (due to Post Office tabulation) and, critically, <strong>immediately &quot;telegraphs&quot; that the letter is commercial</strong>, causing many recipients to dismiss it without reading the pitch. This prevents them from discovering the genuine value of the offer. Also, cannot effectively induce guilt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>PSH (Place Stamp Here) Envelope:</strong> Customer pays postage.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Most economical, and more personal than a BRE.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Gary judges this as the <strong>&quot;best envelope for most mailers to use&quot;</strong> because it balances cost and personalization, and many mailers would be surprised by the results if they tested it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Insights from Bond (Postscript):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bond notes that technology (computers) has largely mitigated the BRE delay issues since this letter was written.</li>
<li>He points out that while reply envelopes remain important, <strong>phone and internet ordering are becoming preferred methods, as &quot;in sales, delay is death.&quot;</strong>.</li>
<li>Bond also reveals Gary&#x27;s tactic of hiding BREs in an inner envelope marked &quot;Do not open until you have read my letter&quot;.</li>
<li>Bond emphasizes the personal significance of Gary&#x27;s detailed descriptions of his writing location, which inspired Bond to do the same for his own children, highlighting their mutual affection.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chapter 13</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Sunday, June 24, 1984.</p>
<p>Gary describes writing from a &quot;hideaway&quot; on &quot;The Hill&quot; in Camp Boron. He points out that he is already implementing the &quot;little ideas&quot; from yesterday&#x27;s lesson in this very letter, such as personal details and immediacy.</p>
<p>He shares his emotional struggle after a call with Bond&#x27;s mom, who feels alone and pressured by financial demands. This &quot;put some pain in my brain&quot;. He recalls Bond&#x27;s insightful comment that he is &quot;luckier than Jeff&quot; because he gets to see Gary solve problems while not rich. Despite wanting to snivel, take drugs, or just rest (and it being his fast day), he chooses to &quot;keep moving in some sort of positive direction&quot; because he <strong>&quot;need[s] to,&quot;</strong> emphasizing that this is a &quot;very very simple (but effective) thing to do&quot; when things are tough.</p>
<p>Gary reiterates how to use an <strong>SRE (Stamped Reply Envelope) to induce guilt in a commercial sales pitch</strong>. He provides a specific example for a &quot;legalized Nevada whorehouse&quot; offer, asking recipients to reply even if they can&#x27;t participate, to free up the limited offer for someone else. The stamped envelope &quot;credentials&quot; the limited offer. He also explains a psychological trick: getting a person to agree to write &quot;No&quot; can sometimes lead them to decide to order instead, simply because they have a pen and paper in hand.</p>
<p>He then revisits <strong>BREs (Business Reply Envelopes)</strong>, highlighting their disadvantages: slowing mail/cash flow and, most importantly, <strong>immediately telegraphing a commercial message</strong>, which often leads recipients to discard the letter without reading the full pitch. He stresses that this is a disservice to the recipient if the offer has genuine value. Finally, he reaffirms that the <strong>PSH (Place Stamp Here) envelope</strong> is generally the <strong>best option for most mailers</strong>, being more economical than SREs and more personal than BREs.</p>
<p><strong>Insights from Bond (Postscript):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bond emphasizes the profound personal connection he feels from Gary&#x27;s detailed descriptions of his writing environment, inspiring him to do the same for his own children. He shares that he visited the now-abandoned Boron prison camp and walked the very hill his father describes. He also highlights the mutual affection and closeness between him and his father.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chapter 14</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Monday, June 25, 1984.</p>
<p>Gary begins by stressing that <strong>attention grabbers in advertisements and sales letters must be &quot;relevant,&quot; tie into the message, and &quot;make sense&quot;</strong>. He warns against &quot;cheap shots,&quot; such as a misleading headline like &quot;A Submarine That Flies?&quot; that then admits it&#x27;s not actually about a flying submarine. Such fraud makes people resentful and should be avoided; attention <em>can</em> be grabbed without &quot;cheating&quot;.</p>
<p>He then uses the example of the <strong>dirt-filled baggie</strong> (from previous chapters) as a relevant attention grabber for a real estate offer. The letter begins by explaining the baggie&#x27;s purpose: to get attention for a serious message, and that the dirt itself is a &quot;passport to complete financial independence&quot; because it represents <strong>&quot;the most valuable thing on earth,&quot; which is real estate, specifically Hawaiian Real Estate from Maui</strong>. This logically connects the physical grabber to the sales message. He emphasizes using words to make the reader &quot;picture with pleasure&quot; the scene, engaging their senses (e.g., feeling sand, smelling salt air).</p>
<p>Gary transitions to the crucial point of <strong>order card and brochure placement</strong>. He warns <strong>against letting the reader see the order card or brochure immediately</strong> upon opening the envelope. The reason is that many readers will jump straight to the order coupon to &quot;see what the deal is&quot; before reading the sales letter, which is undesirable. The order card should be seen at the <strong>&quot;proper time,&quot; which is <em>after</em> the sales letter has been read</strong>.</p>
<p>He reveals his <strong>&quot;secret&quot; for temporarily hiding enclosures</strong>: take an 8.5x11 piece of paper, cut it in half lengthwise, and fold it into thirds. On the back, write a handwritten note in blue ink: <strong>&quot;NOTE: Open this paper to find the special info mentioned in my letter. GH&quot;</strong>. This note, which refers back to the main letter and is personalized, intrigues the reader to finish the letter first. When opened at the appropriate time, this insert then reveals a boxed photo and the order coupon.</p>
<p>Finally, he explains that while letters should be personal, they should also be &quot;<strong>businesslike personal</strong>&quot;. Incorporating typeset elements and photographs adds an &quot;air of stability&quot; to the promotion, making it seem like a &quot;real business&quot; and credentialing the offer. Again, these elements should be seen <strong>&quot;AFTER HE HAS READ OUR LETTER!&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Insights from Bond (Postscript):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bond notes that while the letter&#x27;s advice about BRE delays is less relevant due to computer advancements, the core principle of minimizing &quot;delay&quot; is still crucial. He highlights that &quot;in sales, delay is death,&quot; preferring phone and internet orders which are immediate.</li>
<li>He also reveals Gary&#x27;s specific tactic of hiding enclosures in an envelope explicitly marked &quot;Do not open until you have read my letter,&quot; often containing an order coupon.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chapter 15</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday, June 26, 1984.</p>
<p>Gary wishes Bond a Happy Birthday and expresses pride in him. He shifts from the &quot;conceptualization&quot; of marketing to the <strong>&quot;particulars of how to write copy&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>The first step in writing copy is to <strong>assemble a comprehensive &quot;file&quot; of relevant materials</strong>. This file should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>List cards for targeted mailing lists.</li>
<li>A copy of the product report to be sold.</li>
<li>Copies of successful direct mail pieces and space ads for related products or services by others.</li>
<li>Books and reports on the topic (e.g., real estate investing).</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Exceptionally good ads and DM pieces, even if they are not related to real estate&quot;</strong>.</li>
<li>His &quot;2001 Headlines&quot; book.</li>
<li>Any other &quot;idea generator&quot; material.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once assembled, Bond should read everything and take notes using Gary&#x27;s <strong>&quot;nugget notes&quot; technique</strong>. These notes can be single words, meaningless phrases, or sensible observations, without worrying about perfection—just keep writing what comes to mind. <strong>Always include a complete description of the product and, critically, notes on what the product will <em>do</em> for the customer (the benefits)</strong>, such as making them wealthy, enabling them to buy a better car, or affording vacations. After taking notes, he advises rating them with stars (* for good, ** for better, *** for &quot;red hot&quot;).</p>
<p>A key &quot;quirk&quot; of his process is the <strong>&quot;Aha Experience&quot;</strong>: <strong>after taking notes, Bond must &quot;STOP working on this project. That&#x27;s right. Just let it go. Put it right out of your mind&quot; for a day or two</strong>. During this break, an &quot;outstanding sales idea&quot; will often spontaneously occur, whether it&#x27;s an attention grabber (like the baggie), a new way to visualize benefits, or a fresh sales point.</p>
<p>Once the breakthrough idea emerges, the next step is to <strong>write the letter &quot;according to formula,&quot; specifically using the AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) sequential outline</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A - Attention:</strong> First, get the reader&#x27;s attention.</li>
<li><strong>I - Interest:</strong> Second, get him interested.</li>
<li><strong>D - Desire:</strong> Third, make him desire what you are selling.</li>
<li><strong>A - Action:</strong> Finally, compel him to take the necessary action to get the product.
He promises to elaborate on AIDA in the next letter. The chapter ends with a brief mention of a prison search, highlighting the realities of his environment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chapter 16</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Wednesday, June 27, 1984.</p>
<p>Gary elaborates on the <strong>AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) formula</strong> for writing sales letters:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attention (A):</strong> This is <strong>CRUCIAL</strong>; without it, the letter won&#x27;t be read. He advocates attaching physical objects to letters (coins, dollar bills, foreign currency) as &quot;gimmicks&quot; to grab attention. However, he stresses getting the <strong>&quot;right kind of attention&quot;</strong> by ensuring the grabber is <strong>relevant</strong> and ties in naturally with the letter&#x27;s story, avoiding insults or angering the reader (e.g., the dirt baggie for real estate).</li>
<li><strong>Interest (I):</strong> After capturing attention and making the relevant tie-in, the next step is to catch the reader&#x27;s interest by <strong>&quot;feeding him interesting facts&quot;</strong>. For a Maui real estate offer, this would include facts about potential money to be made, the beach&#x27;s size, its investment opportunity, and even details like pretty girls or fish.</li>
<li><strong>Desire (D):</strong> To arouse desire, Gary advises <strong>describing the <em>benefits</em> the prospect will receive</strong> if they buy the product or service. For an investment offer, the main attraction is making money. He emphasizes helping the prospect <strong>&quot;picture in his mind the benefits of having more money,&quot;</strong> reminding Bond to &quot;always do even the obvious&quot;. Examples of such benefits include a new car (comfort, luxury, status), a nice house, peace of mind (no worries), vacations, attracting the opposite sex, and leisure time.</li>
<li><strong>Action (A):</strong> The final step is to <strong>compel the prospect to take action</strong> (i.e., send an order). Gary notes his thoroughness in closing sales, sometimes dedicating 25% or more of an ad to this. He instructs to be <strong>&quot;very clear, very specific&quot;</strong> and <strong>&quot;lead him by the hand&quot;</strong>. This includes telling the reader exactly where the order coupon is, how to fill it out, how much to send, who to make payments to, how to use the envelope (and if a stamp is needed), and crucially, to <strong>&quot;do all this <em>RIGHT NOW!</em> <em>TODAY!</em>&quot;</strong>. He also advises telling the reader what they will <em>gain</em> by hurrying and what they will <em>lose</em> by delaying.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an assignment, Gary asks Bond to <strong>copy the Tova &quot;facelift ad&quot; in his own handwriting</strong> as if preparing it for a secretarial service, promising to explain the reason later. The chapter ends with Gary congratulating Bond on getting his driver&#x27;s license.</p>
<h3>Chapter 17</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Thursday, June 28, 1984.</p>
<p>Gary explains the purpose behind his assignment to <strong>copy successful ads and direct mail pieces in one&#x27;s own handwriting for several months</strong>: When you physically write out a good ad, &quot;the words and the flow and the sentence structure and the sequence of information and everything else about the writing of that ad <strong>becomes a part of you</strong>&quot;. This is an &quot;internal imprinting&quot; on your mind and body that develops a deep &quot;inside out&quot; understanding of good copywriting. He considers this a vital &quot;discipline that other lazy &#x27;would be&#x27; marketing geniuses will not suffer,&quot; giving those who do it a significant advantage.</p>
<p>He illustrates this with the example of <strong>Arthur Haley, author of &quot;Roots,&quot;</strong> who copied great books by hand to become a master writer. Haley also immersed himself in his subject matter by personally experiencing the miserable conditions of ocean travel for his book, demonstrating the importance of deep, &quot;cellular&quot; knowledge.</p>
<p>Gary provides a list of <strong>&quot;killer&quot; promotions</strong> for Bond to copy, including the Tova Ad, &quot;How To Burn Off Body Fat Hour By Hour,&quot; &quot;The Beverly Hills Diamond Ad,&quot; and &quot;The Original Family Coat-Of-Arms Letter&quot;.</p>
<p>He then offers several tips for <strong>writing good copy (or &quot;good anything&quot;)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <strong>simple, common, everyday words</strong> (e.g., &quot;get&quot; instead of &quot;procure&quot;).</li>
<li>Write <strong>short sentences and short paragraphs</strong>.</li>
<li>Employ <strong>&quot;transition&quot; words and phrases</strong> to ensure smooth flow (e.g., &quot;Well, as a matter of fact,&quot; &quot;Now, naturally,&quot; &quot;And, of course&quot;).</li>
<li><strong>Ask questions and then answer them yourself</strong> to engage the reader (&quot;Bond, do you understand...? You do. Good, then let&#x27;s go on.&quot;).</li>
<li><strong>Good writing makes things &quot;perfectly clear,&quot; easy to understand, and easy to keep reading</strong>. He recommends Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; for clarity.</li>
<li><strong>One-word transition sentences like &quot;Onward.&quot;</strong> also aid flow.</li>
</ul>
<p>He concludes on writing philosophy: <strong>&quot;The Best Way To Become A Good Writer... Is By... Writing Good Writing!&quot;</strong>. He advises against worrying about developing a &quot;style,&quot; as it will emerge naturally. Critically, <strong>&quot;The very best writing goes unnoticed.&quot;</strong> You don&#x27;t want readers to praise your writing style; you want them to <strong>&quot;order from your ad.&quot;</strong>. He warns: <strong>&quot;If you are writing for applause... you will go home with empty pockets!&quot; Write for <em>money</em>!&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, he suggests using <strong>&quot;word pictures&quot;</strong> to help readers vicariously experience the benefits of a product (e.g., describing a jacuzzi&#x27;s soothing water or the aroma of steaks). He also notes the <strong>&quot;judicious use of parentheses&quot;</strong> for &quot;eye relief,&quot; making copy easier to read and understand.</p>
<h3>Chapter 18</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Friday, June 29, 1984.</p>
<p>Gary delves deeper into <strong>&quot;eye relief&quot; and the importance of ad layout</strong>. He notes that people often avoid reading text that looks &quot;forbidding&quot; due to long sentences, long paragraphs, narrow margins, small type, and little white space. He stresses that copy should appear <strong>&quot;inviting to read,&quot; &quot;easy-to-read,&quot; and an &quot;attractive &#x27;eye treat&#x27;&quot;</strong>. This means using <strong>wide margins, white space, double spacing between paragraphs, short words, short sentences, and short paragraphs</strong>.</p>
<p>He then reveals one of his <strong>&quot;very most important secrets,&quot;</strong> claiming it can increase readership by as much as 500% yet remains &quot;virtually unknown&quot; by most advertising professionals. The secret is: <strong>&quot;The Layout Of Your Advertisement Should Catch The Attention Of Your Reader... But... Not In A Way That Causes Him To &#x27;Notice&#x27; The Layout!&quot;</strong>. He explains that editorial content in publications gets five times more readership than advertising. Therefore, <strong>your ads should, &quot;as much as possible, have an &#x27;editorial look&#x27; about them,&quot; specifically like an &quot;exciting piece of editorial material&quot; or a &quot;rave review written by a reporter&quot;</strong>. This includes the look of an &quot;exciting news flash&quot;. He suggests studying editorial layouts, not just ad layouts.</p>
<p>Applying this to direct mail, he advises that DM letters should resemble a personal, enthusiastic letter from a reporter to a friend, perhaps including a snapshot of the product. He provides a powerful example with his <strong>&quot;Family Name Research Report&quot; letter (the Coat-of-Arms letter)</strong>, which initially generated over 7 million cash-with-order customers with a single-page, 361-word letter. Subsequent professional-looking catalogs and brochures bombed. However, when he returned to a <strong>&quot;very personal sales letter&quot; enclosing a <em>snapshot</em> of the best-selling item</strong>, it generated <strong>$40 Million!</strong>.</p>
<p>The moral of this story is profound: <strong>&quot;YOU CAN DO A BETTER SELLING JOB WHEN AT FIRST IT DOES NOT APPEAR YOU ARE ATTEMPTING TO DO A SALES JOB.&quot;</strong>. He closes by foreshadowing his next topic: &quot;You Never Get A Second Chance To Make A First Impression!&quot;.</p>
<h3>Chapter 19</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Saturday, June 30, 1984.</p>
<p>Gary introduces the core subject: <strong>&quot;You Never Get A Second Chance To Make A First Impression.&quot;</strong> He illustrates this with several examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Job interviewers decide within the first <strong>40 seconds</strong>.</li>
<li>Jury members make up their minds during the first <strong>half-hour</strong> of a trial.</li>
<li>Love happens &quot;almost instantaneously&quot;.</li>
<li>A reader is &quot;hooked or lose[d]... when he very first <em>looks</em> at your ad or DM piece,&quot; <strong>not when he reads it</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>He clarifies that while exceptions exist, <strong>most people will never alter their initial impression</strong>, instead &quot;edit[ing]&quot; new information to validate their original opinion.</p>
<p>The implication for advertising is that your ad or direct mail piece should instantly give the prospect a &quot;lift&quot; and cause their pupils to dilate (an involuntary reaction to seeing something liked). Gary theorizes that many decisions are made in the <strong>&quot;first fraction of a second&quot;</strong> of seeing something new, with the rest of &quot;decision making time&quot; spent <strong>&quot;searching for justification for the decision we have <em>already made</em>.&quot;</strong>. Therefore, the &quot;sale&quot; or &quot;no sale&quot; decision is largely made the <strong>instant a prospect sees your ad and reads your headline</strong>. If they get an &quot;instant &#x27;lift&#x27;,&quot; they will start reading, <em>looking for reasons to convince themselves the ad&#x27;s promise is true</em>.</p>
<p>To achieve this &quot;lift,&quot; promotions need a &quot;<strong>crisp&#x27; look</strong>&quot; – clean layout, strong contrast, and inviting readability. Pictures should be upbeat (e.g., &quot;after&quot; photos). He also notes that women prefer pictures of women in ads, and men prefer men.</p>
<p>For direct mail, he provides specific enhancements for a &quot;lift&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <strong>good, crisp white paper</strong> for letters and envelopes.</li>
<li>If using labels, use <strong>tight white labels on matching envelopes</strong>.</li>
<li>Use <strong>large, colorful commemorative stamps</strong> whenever practical.</li>
<li>Dignified, non-distracting letterhead.</li>
<li>Serif typeface, typed with a carbon ribbon for clarity.</li>
<li>If using a second color for underlining, use <strong>RED</strong>.</li>
<li>Photographs/simulated photos should be <strong>crisp, clean, glossy, and clear</strong>, not &quot;cheap, limp and soggy&quot;. These rules apply to all enclosures.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chapter 20</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Sunday, July 1, 1984.</p>
<p>Gary reflects on Dennis Haslinger&#x27;s advice that most serious mistakes are &quot;bad ego decisions,&quot; which Gary has found true in his life regarding women, money, and physical danger. He recounts a recent prison confrontation where a roommate yelled at him over loud radio use and threatened him. Despite his desire to explain or &quot;run a &#x27;macho trip,&#x27;&quot; Gary <strong>remained silent, &quot;eating a little humble pie,&quot;</strong> believing it was the right decision despite feeling cowardly.</p>
<p>He explains his reasons for not escalating:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical danger:</strong> The roommate was also physical and experienced in prison workouts.</li>
<li><strong>Risk of harming the roommate:</strong> Gary is also physically capable.</li>
<li><strong>Severe consequences:</strong> A fight would lead to transfer to a higher-security prison and loss of &quot;good time,&quot; potentially adding six months to his sentence.
Gary then asserts that <strong>&quot;everything in this letter has a lot to do with creating better ads and DM pieces!&quot;</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>He connects his actions to a broader principle: by staying in the room, working on his letter (even with shaky handwriting from adrenaline), planning his schedule, and doing road work, he is <strong>&quot;clearing the deck&quot; and getting emotional &quot;garbage out of my system&quot; so his strategic decisions, future letters, and ideas will be clear</strong>.</p>
<p>He introduces the acronym <strong>HALT: Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired.</strong> His crucial advice: <strong>&quot;you should never make a decision when you are any of those things.&quot;</strong>. Instead, do what he did: write, run, walk, talk, or jog, but choose who you communicate with carefully, as the <strong>&quot;process&quot; or &quot;physical act&quot; of these activities <em>is</em> the therapy, not necessarily the content</strong>. The key principle is: <strong>&quot;You Don&#x27;t Have To Get It Right... You Just Have To Get It MOVING!&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>He contrasts this incident with another in prison where he had to directly confront a loud, strong inmate who snatched his pool cue. In that instance, Gary got &quot;eyeball to eyeball&quot; and firmly took his stick back, demonstrating his ability to <em>be</em> tough when genuinely necessary.</p>
<h3>Chapter 21</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Monday, July 2, 1984.</p>
<p>Gary discusses <strong>&quot;propositions,&quot; which are the &quot;deal&quot; you offer</strong> in direct mail and mail order selling. Examples include buy-one-get-one-free, book club models (many items for a low price with a commitment to buy more later), or discounts for immediate or bulk purchases. The most common proposition is simply exchanging product for money.</p>
<p>A very important ingredient for making propositions work is the <strong>&quot;reason why&quot;</strong>. If you offer a good deal without an explanation, it won&#x27;t be believable. Common &quot;reasons why&quot; for deals include: going out of business, a fire sale, owing taxes, losing a lease, or needing to make space for new merchandise.</p>
<p>Gary takes a detour to emphasize using more <strong>powerful, visceral language</strong> in copy. Instead of &quot;dramatically increase your sales volume,&quot; he suggests &quot;make yourself a bushel of money!&quot;. He advises: <strong>&quot;Bring your story down to earth and hit &#x27;em where they live. (In their hearts and their pocketbooks!)&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>He shares his personal hurt over his ex-girlfriend seeing someone new while he&#x27;s in prison, and describes his coping mechanism: <strong>&quot;I Just Keep On Keepin&#x27; On.&quot;</strong> He deals with the pain by writing, doing road work and chores, and avoiding sniveling. He believes one cannot always control what happens, but has control over their responses.</p>
<p>He then introduces the <strong>&quot;far more compelling &#x27;excuse for a deal&#x27;&quot;: &quot;I Am Offering You This Deal Because You (By Virtue Of Some Unique Circumstance) Are So Special.&quot;</strong>. He revisits the <strong>Family Crest Wall Plaque example</strong>, explaining how he leveraged the unique circumstance of having a specific family&#x27;s crest plaque in stock (used for publicity photos) to offer it at a &quot;true and honest discount&quot; to someone with that specific family name. This approach generated an astounding <strong>$40 Million in Sales!</strong>.</p>
<p>He provides other examples of using this &quot;you are special&quot; approach: offering a car because a customer wants that specific trade-in, offering unique art to an &quot;astute judge of art&quot; for their opinion, or contacting someone because a mutual friend said they were the &quot;best judge of value&quot; for a book. He also gives examples of attention-grabbing openings using this principle, such as attaching a dollar bill with a message for &quot;every other real estate agent in L.A. County,&quot; or highlighting the rarity of a family name.</p>
<h3>Chapter 22</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday, July 3, 1984.</p>
<p>Gary introduces a &quot;little trick&quot; to improve copywriting: <strong>&quot;read your copy out loud.&quot;</strong>. When read aloud, you&#x27;ll &quot;verbally stumble over all the places that are not smooth,&quot; revealing awkward phrasing or flow issues. The solution is to rewrite those rough spots and repeat the process until the copy flows perfectly &quot;without a bump or a bubble&quot;. He considers advertising writing &quot;the best writing of all&quot;. He connects this to his earlier advice: reading <em>other people&#x27;s</em> good ads and DM pieces aloud <em>and</em> copying them by hand will &quot;internally imprinting on your nerves, muscle fibers, brain cells and every fiber of your being&quot; the process of good writing.</p>
<p>He then outlines the <strong>business process of mail order &quot;deals&quot;</strong> he puts together with his &quot;bankers&quot; (investors):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Find a hot mailing list</strong> in the SRDS book.</li>
<li><strong>Find or create a product to sell to that list</strong>, preferably &quot;paper and ink&quot; (written reports that solve problems). He lists past successful report titles like &quot;How To Raise Your Child&#x27;s I.Q. Before It Is Even Born!&quot; and &quot;How To Collect From Social Security At Any Age!&quot; (which made him $800,000).</li>
<li><strong>Discuss the project with a &quot;banker&quot;</strong> who, if interested, provides about $5,000 to cover product development, test names, and test mailing costs.</li>
<li>He creates the DM promotion and mails it.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze results:</strong> It will be a loser, a winner, or marginal.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Loser:</strong> Banker loses $5,000.</li>
<li><strong>Winner:</strong> Banker invests another $50,000 for a 100,000-piece mailing, with subsequent mailings financed by cash flow, and profits split 50/50.</li>
<li><strong>Marginal:</strong> They decide whether to risk another $5,000 for a retest.
This, he says, is a &quot;nice simple way of doing business&quot;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>He then provides a concise <strong>outline of the steps to direct mail success</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find a hot market (mailing list).</li>
<li>Find or create a product (preferably paper and ink) for that market.</li>
<li>Create a direct mail promotion describing the product and its benefits.</li>
<li>Make a test mailing (1,000-5,000 pieces).</li>
<li>Analyze results.</li>
<li>If good, mail 20,000-100,000 more letters.</li>
<li>If still good, start rolling out and taking care of business.
He emphasizes that it&#x27;s a simple procedure with excellent chances of success if common sense is used.</li>
</ol>
<p>Gary then highlights the <strong>most common mistake leading to MO &amp; DM failure</strong>: <strong>&quot;finding or developing a product <em>FIRST</em> and then looking for a market to sell it to.&quot;</strong> He declares this &quot;backasswards&quot; and states: <strong>&quot;You Must Always Find A Market <em>First</em>... And <em>Then</em> Concentrate On A Product!&quot;</strong>. He concludes that products are &quot;a dime a dozen&quot; and less crucial than finding a hot market, because a hot market will <em>always</em> have a product to fill its needs.</p>
<h3>Chapter 23</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Wednesday, July 4, 1984.</p>
<p>Despite the 114-degree heat, fasting, and being in prison, Gary lists his ongoing productive activities: roadwork, ad changes, letters, and maintaining relationships. He uses this to <strong>&quot;give you some guilt&quot;</strong> (to Bond) because Bond admitted to not doing his roadwork. Gary powerfully states: <strong>&quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter <em>how much</em> you learn if you don&#x27;t <em>use</em> what you learn.&quot;</strong>. He urges Bond to &quot;just do it&quot; and &quot;KEEP ON KEEPING ON,&quot; reminding him of his own challenging circumstances in prison.</p>
<p>He discusses a key differentiator between successful people and those who are not: <strong>&quot;awareness.&quot;</strong>. Most people are &quot;lost in a fog,&quot; easily &quot;shorn&quot; like sheep. In prison (a microcosm of society), one must be <strong>&quot;alert, on top of things and ready at any time to &#x27;catch a break&#x27;&quot;</strong>. Inmates who succeed take care of themselves: exercise, grooming, reading, and studying.</p>
<p>This awareness applies directly to business: fortunes are made by those who are <strong>&quot;on top of things&quot; in their fields</strong>. They:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay up to date and read trade journals.</li>
<li>Are on competitors&#x27; mailing lists.</li>
<li>Read &quot;HOT&quot; mail order publications.</li>
<li>Keep their &quot;SWIPE FILE&quot; current.</li>
<li>Read classic books by field experts.</li>
<li>Maintain &quot;idea files&quot; (newspaper articles, unusual info, layouts, propositions).</li>
<li>Communicate regularly with industry leaders.
Gary attributes his reputation as an &quot;advertising genius&quot; to one overlooked reason: <strong>&quot;I Work Like Crazy!&quot;</strong>. He uses a poker analogy: while everyone is dealt similar hands, <strong>winners are determined by <em>how they play</em> those cards</strong> – exploiting good hands, dumping bad ones, and adapting mediocre ones. He also stresses the importance of &quot;<strong>sweat[ing] the details</strong>&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, Gary addresses <strong>believability in promotions</strong>, stating that giving <strong>exact details</strong> increases it. Instead of vague statements, use specifics like &quot;77.6% of all car owners&quot; or exact weight loss figures. He notes that small, seemingly irrelevant details (like mentioning his &quot;blue&quot; bandanna) draw the reader closer and make the communication &quot;more real&quot; and believable, provided they don&#x27;t distract from the message itself. He also links awareness to knowing the time without a clock, suggesting a self-check for being &quot;on top of things&quot;.</p>
<h3>Chapter 24</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Thursday, July 5, 1984.</p>
<p>Gary announces he will temporarily stop writing letters after tomorrow. His reasons are:</p>
<ol>
<li>He needs to review reference material and outline future letters, as his current &quot;babblings&quot; are becoming too random.</li>
<li>Bond needs to get the first 25 letters typed up for his own review and note-taking.</li>
<li>Gary needs to catch up on other work, including filing a legal motion to modify his sentence and potentially get out earlier.</li>
<li><strong>He has &quot;bankers&quot; eager for him to develop new promotions that they will finance with a 50/50 profit split.</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>He intends for Bond to learn by <strong>&quot;watch[ing] over my shoulder as I begin to create one profitable promotion after another&quot;</strong>. He outlines his process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go through the SRDS book and identify &quot;hot markets&quot; (lists).</li>
<li>Review these lists with Eric for feedback.</li>
<li>Develop product ideas for the selected lists, welcoming Bond&#x27;s input.</li>
<li>Codify projects and pitch them to his &quot;bankers&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Bankers&#x27; Investment:</strong> If a banker is interested, they provide a <strong>$5,000 &quot;development fee&quot;</strong> to cover DM piece creation, a test mailing (2-5,000 names), and product development.</li>
<li><strong>Results:</strong> If the test fails, the banker absorbs the $5,000 loss. If results are good, they proceed with a larger mailing (e.g., 50,000 pieces), and if still good, they &quot;start rolling out&quot;.
Gary plans to keep Bond informed and even give him a &quot;small cut of the action&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<p>He then shifts to the subject of <strong>&quot;IMPACT&quot; in direct mail promotions</strong>. He notes that the average American is subjected to about 1,500 commercial messages daily, but few have &quot;appreciable impact&quot;. His favorite way to achieve impact is by <strong>&quot;attaching things to the top of my letters&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>He describes the <strong>classic &quot;dollar bill&quot; letter</strong> from &quot;The Robert Collier Letter Book&quot;: a first-class letter for a children&#x27;s hospital fundraiser that had a <strong>real dollar bill attached</strong>. The copy explained the writer&#x27;s strategy of mailing 1,000 dollar bills, hoping recipients would return it with more of their own. This letter was &quot;probably the most effective direct mail promotion ever mailed,&quot; achieving <strong>over 90% response and generating tens of millions of dollars.</strong> &quot;That&#x27;s Impact!&quot;. He also mentions his successful Japanese &quot;Penny&quot; promotion, where a penny was attached as an attention-grabber relevant to the product&#x27;s Japanese origin.</p>
<p><strong>A crucial warning:</strong> Whatever you attach must <strong>&quot;tie in with the rest of your letter and what you are selling. It should make sense and fit into the promotion in a natural way.&quot;</strong>. He illustrates <strong>how <em>not</em> to use impact</strong> with the example of &quot;traffic ticket&quot; ads placed on car windshields. While they grab attention and are remembered, they evoke <strong>&quot;Distaste! He Will Remember That This Is A Company That Scared Him And Made Him Angry! No Sale!&quot;</strong>. The message: &quot;You must not use &#x27;cheap tricks&#x27;.&quot;. He offers original examples of relevant attachments, such as an eagle feather for conservation or a Mexican Peso for inflation (which he used successfully).</p>
<h3>Chapter 25</h3>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> Friday, July 7, 1984.</p>
<p>Gary recounts a minor confrontation in the chow hall with an inmate he calls &quot;The Rodent&quot; over ice, where Gary chose to &quot;glare&quot; and walk away despite feeling he could have easily won a physical fight. He explains that both this incident and a previous one with his roommate occurred when he was <strong>&quot;off&quot;</strong> – meaning not at his best mentally or physically. <strong>&quot;When I am off, when <em>anybody</em> is off, this is <em>communicated</em>!&quot;</strong>. He was vulnerable from fasting twice, missing his girlfriend &quot;L,&quot; and generally feeling sad. In prison, his &quot;Karma&quot; (mental state) is especially critical, as it&#x27;s &quot;a bad place to be weak, even a little and even momentarily&quot;. Indicators of being &quot;off&quot; include being slightly clumsy or off on time (as noted in Chapter 23). He points out he was also suffering from <strong>HALT (Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired)</strong> when the incidents happened.</p>
<p>He admits that in both confrontations, he was &quot;wrong&quot; by not being &quot;aware and on top of things&quot;. He failed to notice his radio was disturbing others or that &quot;The Rodent&quot; was deliberately rationing ice. While these might be minor issues on the street, in prison, there is &quot;a lot less slack&quot;.</p>
<p>His strategy for dealing with being &quot;off&quot;: <strong>&quot;lay low for a while until I am feeling strong and not feeling vulnerable.&quot;</strong>. This involves temporarily avoiding fellow inmates and adjusting his fasting schedule. He believes that if he had been &quot;pumped&quot; (physically strong and mentally sharp), these incidents wouldn&#x27;t have happened because he would have been more alert and emitted different &quot;vibes&quot;. Blurred vision is another personal indicator of stress for him.</p>
<p>He relates this to business success: <strong>&quot;At the time in my life when I was making the most money, I followed the same procedure I am talking about here. Namely: I pay attention to myself and when I am off, I drop out of sight and do what is necessary to strengthen myself.&quot;</strong>. This is vital because <strong>&quot;People can smell it when you are weak. When you are vulnerable. They can smell success too. They can sniff out a winner. And you can&#x27;t fake it. Not for long. You&#x27;ve got to <em>be</em> it!&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>He details his immediate plan to regain strength: not skipping running, even after fasting, and getting up early to run on Sunday. He shares finding a valuable friend in prison who gives similar advice (don&#x27;t sink to their level, avoid cursing, exercise).</p>
<p>As this is the last of his first batch of letters, Gary expresses longing for freedom and acknowledges how precious &quot;the good times and the <em>good people</em> are&quot;. He hopes to never again neglect his special relationships, particularly with Bond. He concludes with his resolve to <strong>&quot;go underground&quot; and &quot;quietly strengthen myself,&quot; aiming to become an expert at &quot;quietly diffusing explosive situations and sending out stronger vibes&quot;</strong> to prevent future negative encounters.</p></article></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"content":"# Notes - The Boron Letters - Life and Marketing Wisdom\n*March 2, 2025*\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Date:** Tuesday, June 12, 1984.\n\nGary Halbert begins a series of letters to his son, Bond, aiming to share crucial lessons learned over 46 years on topics such as **selling by mail, health, interpersonal relationships, and general life wisdom**, even hinting at \"sex, drugs and rock and roll!\". He plans to write for about an hour daily, except Sundays, and intends to use these letters as source material for a future book, possibly titled \"How To Be Your Own Messiah\". He notes that the letters will \"ramble around somewhat\" as he prioritizes flow over precise editing.\n\nOn his birthday, Gary feels good because he was able to run \"the hill\" non-stop for the first time, a steep 8/10 of a mile route. Just three weeks prior, he could barely walk it once, and now aims to run it ten times (8 miles) without stopping.\n\nThe **\"first and most important thing\"** he addresses is **improving and maintaining health and physical fitness**. He strongly recommends an hour of daily \"road work\" (walking, jogging, running) six days a week, ideally right after waking up. He suggests a morning routine of washing up, eating a piece of fruit (preferably a banana), and then immediately heading out for about 30 minutes out and back. The benefits are enormous: it \"cleans you out,\" \"settles you down,\" provides a \"nice glow,\" makes you \"more clearheaded,\" and improves thinking. He believes this practice will lead to a \"positive addiction\".\n\nThis **positive addiction** is described as a real, physiological phenomenon: after about 40 minutes of road work, the brain secretes \"survival chemicals\" like **beta endorphins and norepinephrine**, which some claim are 200 times stronger than morphine. This creates a beneficial \"high\" that is natural and makes you \"zestful rather than speedy,\" unlike artificial drug highs. He emphasizes this as \"very close to being the most important thing of all\" he has learned. Gary asks Bond to get \"The Joy of Running\" by Theodore Kostrubala.\n\n**Insights from Bond (Postscript):**\n*   This first letter is often overlooked but clearly emphasizes health, a topic Gary prioritized because his own father died at 59 of heart failure.\n*   Gary, despite being hard on his body previously, lived ten years longer than his father, confirmed by the medical examiner who noted he was in \"great shape\" except for a hereditary blocked artery.\n*   Bond personally found jogging difficult due to knee issues and the time it took to feel endorphins, preferring non-competitive sports like bicycling.\n*   **Hidden Lesson: Try Things At Least Twice.** Both Gary's progress on the hill and Bond's bicycling experience illustrate that **first attempts are often \"sloppy and lame\" and may fail, but a second attempt provides crucial learning and makes the task \"much easier\"**. This applies to all of life and is a key differentiator for success, as most people quit after a poor first experience.\n*   **Hidden Lesson: Stephen Covey's Four Square Lesson on Life (Time Management).** Getting up early for road work relates to the concept of categorizing activities into four quadrants:\n    *   **Q1: Urgent \u0026 Important** (e.g., fixing a broken arm).\n    *   **Q2: Important \u0026 Not Urgent** (e.g., working out, prostate exam). **Winners and successful people spend significantly more time in Q2**. Doing Q2 tasks proactively helps avoid them becoming urgent Q1 problems later.\n    *   **Q3: Urgent \u0026 Not Important** (e.g., getting to a store before it closes).\n    *   **Q4: Not Urgent \u0026 Not Important** (e.g., reading a classic novel).\n    Gary emphasizes doing important things early in the morning before the day's urgent demands (emails, calls) consume your time. This applies to business as well, such as testing marketing campaigns or writing copy. He suggests **90% of successful people get up early (or stay up late) to work uninterrupted**.\n\n### Chapter 2\n\n**Date:** Wednesday, June 13, 1984.\n\nGary mentions developing a new \"get tough\" attitude after a negative meeting. He again stresses the immense value of **road work as the \"number one most valuable habit,\"** stating it improves the entire day by draining tension and anxiety, and clearing the mind for better thinking.\n\nHe introduces **fasting** as another important health habit, recommending Bond (despite his youth) fast one full day each week. Gary fasts every Saturday and plans to continue for life, noting benefits like normalizing body functions and developing self-discipline. **Tips for fasting:** do not tell others about it due to their \"ignorant babble,\" and avoid strenuous athletic exercise on fast days to allow for physical and mental rest. Gary uses his fast days for reading, puttering, and small chores. He equates road work to \"ordering your day\" and fasting to \"**ordering your week**\". He considers these two things the most important lessons he's ever learned.\n\nRegarding diet, Gary states breakfast is *not* the most important meal; he recommends only a couple of pieces of fruit before lunch, with one (preferably a banana) before road work. He suggests eating **three pieces of fruit daily** (banana, apple, or orange) for nutrients and bowel health, calling fruit \"the prize food of man\" and a necessary food for Americans. He also recommends a **big bowl of \"bran type\" cereal** (like Grapenuts) and a large glass of **non-fat milk** daily, plus at least one serving of **lean meat or fowl**. He cautions to limit eggs due to cholesterol. He also suggests **protein powder as \"protein insurance\"** for growing boys. He encourages flexibility in diet after healthy eating, advising common sense over strict prohibitions against treats like ice cream.\n\nGary expresses a desire to start a \"Halbert Tradition\" where fathers pass down what they've learned to the next generation. He also recommends \"The Miracle of Fasting\" by Paul Bragg and \"Are You Confused?\" by Paulo Airola. He reassures Bond not to feel pressured to write back as much as he does.\n\nHe recounts a story about \"Crackers,\" an \"arrogant\" tomcat at the camp who torments small animals. This anecdote leads to the powerful quote Gary read: **\"There is no justice. There is only power.\"**.\n\n**Insights from Bond (Postscript):**\n*   Bond clarifies Gary was always tough, not just \"getting tough\" now, having overcome significant life challenges. Gary's toughness surfaced particularly against \"mean people\" and cruelty. This mental toughness was a vital \"survival skill\" and \"mental armor\".\n*   While Bond tried fasting, he found it unpleasant. He affirms Gary's nutritional advice, noting Gary was in great physical condition at his death, despite his hereditary heart issues.\n*   **Most Overlooked Lesson: \"Don't Tell Anyone.\"** Gary's advice not to tell others about fasting carries a deeper meaning derived from his favorite saying: **\"nothing is impossible for a man who refuses to listen to reason\"**. Most people are \"nay sayers\" who will discourage grand ambitions. It's often better to **\"just silently go about proving or accomplishing your goal\"** without arguing, like the doctor who proved ulcers were caused by organisms despite widespread disbelief.\n*   Gary's desire to pass down wisdom inspired Bond to write letters to his own children.\n*   The \"Crackers\" story and the \"no justice, only power\" quote resonated with Gary due to his own experiences of being wealthy and broke multiple times, and being in prison for a crime he felt he didn't commit. Bond notes Gary's ability to \"move on\" from difficult situations.\n\n### Chapter 3\n\n**Date:** Thursday, June 14, 1984.\n\nGary reports continued progress on \"The Hill,\" jogging it twice non-stop, feeling \"lean and mean\". He reviews his prior health recommendations: daily road work, three pieces of fruit, and a large bowl of bran cereal.\n\nHe expands on diet, advising a **lot of vegetables**, suggesting Bond cut them up nightly and carry them for snacking throughout the day. He refutes the idea of not eating between meals, recommending **six small meals instead of three big ones**, or simply nibbling when hungry to maintain constant blood sugar and avoid tiredness.\n\nA crucial lesson is emphasized: **do not depend on others to prepare your food or help you stay healthy**. Gary stresses developing a **\"tough independent attitude\"** to avoid making excuses for failure by relying on others. He reiterates the importance of daily non-fat milk, lean meat/fowl, limited eggs, and adding bran flakes and protein powder to the diet. He adds that if you consistently do road work and eat well, you won't have much room or desire for junk food.\n\nGary outlines his ambitious **11-month plan for writing his book**, starting with 3 months for the letters to Bond, then collecting notes, outlining, and drafting. He sees prison as \"the best place to write and get healthy I've ever been\".\n\nHe advises Bond to focus on **developing strong, muscular arms** through presses and curls, but cautions against an \"exaggerated body builder's body,\" which he believes women are generally not attracted to. He prefers a \"lean and hard\" physique. The reasons for arm development are practicality (strength), attractiveness to women, and crucially, in prison, **\"just having big arms can keep you out of a lot of trouble\"**.\n\n**Insights from Bond (Postscript):**\n*   Bond agrees with Gary's health and workout advice.\n*   **The \"Don't Rely on Anyone\" Lesson (Financial Context).** This expands on the previous chapter's theme of self-reliance, particularly in the context of making money. Bond explains that friends and family often react negatively to ambitious financial plans, not consciously, but because your potential success makes them question their own choices. There is an \"irrational hatred of the rich\". Therefore, it is **\"vital that you never let the bastards get you down,\"** and to surround yourself with supportive people or those who are already successful. A support system requires actively weeding out negative influences, like a garden.\n*   **Intentional Repetition.** Bond highlights that Gary's frequent repetition is **\"100% intentional\"**. This is a business lesson akin to the Godfather's advice to review plans repeatedly to avoid carelessness. **Winners constantly revise and reassess their plans**.\n*   The two key lessons from this chapter are: 1) the great advantage of **shutting out the negative attitudes of the masses**, and 2) **winners revise their plans over and over and constantly reassess**.\n\n### Chapter 4\n\n**Date:** Friday, June 15, 1984.\n\nGary expresses gratitude for his family's visit and their role as a \"strong outside 'support system'\". He explains his need to leave early due to commissary (for fruit) and to spend time with a friend who was leaving, illustrating his prioritization.\n\nHe revisits the ideal male physique: **lean and hard with strong muscular arms, but not a \"bulging, exaggerated weight-lifter's body\"**. He expands on the reasons for arm development: practical strength, attraction to women, and gaining respect from men. He asserts that a **\"fat, sloppy or skinny and weak body tends to broadcast... lacking self-respect\"**.\n\nA profound lesson is introduced: **\"DEFENSIVE BEHAVIOR INVITES AGGRESSIVE ACTION!\"**. In life, and especially in prison, there is little sympathy for weakness. He illustrates this with an inmate who acts perpetually scared and subservient, sending out signals like **\"I'm scared. I'm a pussy. I'm easy. I'm vulnerable.\"**. This behavior irritates Gary and attracts predators.\n\nThe core message emerges: it is **\"far better to: Rely On Your Own Strength Instead Of Somebody Else's Compassion!\"**. He clarifies that this means *being* tough, not just acting tough or being mean. Predators choose easy targets. When one \"gets tough,\" their entire demeanor changes – appearance, movement, reactions, and overall \"signals\". He echoes John D. Rockefeller that nothing is as satisfying as self-reliance. Developing strong arms, he notes, is a practical way to **\"avoid fights without losing your dignity,\"** as it sends a deterrent signal (\"Damn! Look at the arms on that guy!\").\n\nAssuming Bond is now committed to health, Gary declares he will temporarily shift focus to **how to make money**, returning to health and fitness later. He concludes with anecdotes about other inmates, including a heroin dealer and a man who blinded a snitch, highlighting the harsh realities of prison life and individual \"ways\" of dealing with it.\n\n**Insights from Bond (Postscript):**\n*   Bond confirms Gary's excellent prioritization, beginning his letters with health before moving to his unique lessons.\n*   Gary possessed a rare and enviable ability to **\"eradicat[e] people from his life if they were not a positive influence,\"** even family, to maintain a positive support system. Bond emphasizes that the \"real trick is to cut out those that hold you back\". This is likened to a garden where you must constantly pull weeds.\n*   In business, Gary always sought to appear strong, which meant carrying himself with confidence.\n*   The Rockefeller quote reinforces that **self-reliance is often the true motive of great businessmen, more so than money**.\n\n### Chapter 5\n\n**Date:** Saturday, June 16, 1984.\n\nGary delves into the subject of making money, declaring the #1 big secret: **get involved in whatever excites you most.** He states, \"**Money, in my opinion, especially big money, is most often a by product of enthusiasm.**\". He advises to hire the most enthusiastic person, not necessarily the most qualified, as **attitude is paramount**.\n\nHe then transitions to direct marketing, stressing that the very first and most important thing to realize is that you **must become a \"student of markets,\"** not products, techniques, or copywriting. The way to deduce what people want to buy is to **\"simply observe what they DO buy!\"**.\n\nGary illustrates the crucial distinction between what people *say* they buy and what they *actually do* with examples:\n*   A beer company survey showed customers preferred premium beer, yet sales data showed they bought regular beer. People often give the \"right\" answer they *should* drink.\n*   Despite almost everyone putting down \"The National Enquirer,\" it is the **largest selling newspaper in the world \"BY FAR!\"**.\n*   Many claim the Bible is their most read book, yet \"damn-few people have actually READ the Bible\". Gary provocatively states: **\"MORE PEOPLE READ THE 'NATIONAL ENQUIRER' IN ONE SINGLE WEEK THAN HAVE EVER READ THE BIBLE IN THE LAST 2,000 YEARS!\"**.\nHe concludes that to be a top marketer, you must be a **\"student of reality\"** – understanding \"how it *really* is\".\n\nTo find out what people *actually* buy via direct response, he recommends using **\"The SRDS Direct Mail List Book,\"** specifically reading the CONSUMER LISTS section. He advises paying close attention to the **\"numbers involved\" and \"average unit of sale\"** (the higher, the better). He gives examples of \"Diamond And Ruby Buyers\" and \"Diamond Buyers And Enquirers\" lists, calculating their massive potential sales volume, emphasizing that the \"greed glands\" will get going.\n\n### Chapter 6\n\n**Date:** Sunday, June 17, 1984.\n\nGary continues on the theme of being a \"student of markets.\" He presents his famous **\"hamburger stand\" analogy**: if competing to sell the most hamburgers, the only advantage he would want is **\"A STARVING CROWD!\"**. This teaches to constantly seek out **groups of people (markets) who are \"starving (or at least hungry!) for some particular product or service\"**.\n\nHe then outlines a progression of mailing list quality for selling an investment book, from worst to best:\n*   **Possibility #1: Phone book names:** Terrible due to too many non-prospects and \"waste circulation\" (like shooting with a shotgun).\n*   **Possibility #2: Phone book names from high-income areas:** A little better, but still \"not nearly good enough\" due to diversity within zip codes and continued waste.\n*   **Possibility #3: High-income professionals (doctors, lawyers, etc.):** \"Not bad,\" as they likely have the *ability* to invest, but not necessarily the interest.\n*   **Possibility #4: Wealthy, proven mail order buyers:** \"Getting down to business,\" as mail order buyers of *anything* are generally better than non-buyers.\n*   **Possibility #5: Wealthy, mail order buyers of *other investment books*:** Now \"cooking,\" as they are wealthy, MO buyers, and have purchased a similar product.\n*   **Possibility #6: Wealthy, *repeat* mail order buyers of similar investment books:** Even \"sweeter,\" as they are repeat buyers, indicating high desire.\n*   **Possibility #7: Wealthy, repeat mail order buyers of similar investment books who paid *big money*:** \"Very close to the 'crème de la crème'\".\n*   **Possibility #8: All of #7, *and* who have *recently* made such a purchase:** \"Almost as good a list as we can get,\" and typically the best rentable list.\n*   **Possibility #9: All of #8, *and* a good list broker confirms it's working well for other similar mailers:** The true \"best list you can mail to\" by renting.\n*   **Possibility #10: YOUR OWN CUSTOMER LIST!** Assuming they are satisfied customers, this is the best list of all, outperforming any other.\n\nGary then briefly detours into the importance of **client control**, stating he often uses an \"iron fist\" with clients, as many will try to dictate copy, leading to \"miserable failures\". He believes clients are often relieved when the expert (copywriter) takes firm control (\"don't you dare mess with my copy\"). He also stresses structuring deals to get paid **\"often,\"** because clients struggle to write big checks, especially once they have the ad.\n\nHe encapsulates a core principle: **\"Sell People What They Want To Buy!\"**. He advises observing which ads and direct mail pieces repeatedly appear, as this indicates they \"hit a nerve\". The goal is to hit that same nerve, only better. **\"All You Have To Do Is Observe!\"**.\n\n### Chapter 7\n\n**Date:** Monday, June 18, 1984.\n\nContinuing on mailing lists, Gary reinforces that proven mail order buyers outperform non-buyers. He introduces the **three main guidelines for selecting lists to test: Recency, Frequency, and Unit of Sale (RFM)**.\n*   **Recency:** **By far the most important.** The more recently a person purchased a similar item by mail, the more receptive they will be. \"Hotline buyers\" (most recent buyers, e.g., 30-day or 90-day) are \"extremely good prospects\".\n*   **Frequency:** The more often a person buys a particular item, the higher their desire for that product or service type.\n*   **Unit of Sale:** A higher price paid for a previous purchase indicates a \"hotter prospect\" for similar products. He states: **\"people don't always put their money where their mouths are; but they do nearly always put out their money where their true desires are.\"**.\n\nHe advises finding \"hot\" mail order publications by observing where mail order companies advertise repeatedly. He suggests getting copies of the top 100 magazines (from the \"Gallagher Report\") to identify those with many mail order ads.\n\nHe again emphasizes his philosophy of **client control**, recalling a challenging situation with a client named Z. He asserts that clients often try to micromanage, leading to poor results, and that his \"hard headed\" approach (a \"don't you dare mess with my copy\" attitude) is why he's in such high demand. He also touches on ensuring timely payments by structuring deals to get paid \"often,\" as clients often struggle to write big checks, especially once the ad is delivered.\n\nGary reiterates his core marketing rule: **\"Sell People What They Want To Buy!\"** which is \"so obvious, so overlooked and so important\". He once more stresses the importance of **observing repeating ads and direct mail pieces** as indicators of what's working (\"hitting a nerve\"). You don't need to guess or survey; **\"All You Have To Do Is Observe!\"**.\n\n### Chapter 8\n\n**Date:** Tuesday, June 19, 1984.\n\nGary discusses the choice between working and resting when tired. He differentiates between a \"lack of discipline\" (halting progress for minor fatigue) and \"foolishness\" (pushing when chronically tired or sick). His approach: **start working anyway, monitor body signals, and only stop if truly feeling worse; otherwise, \"keep on plugging along.\"** He quotes, \"**Most of the world's work is done by people who didn't feel much like getting out of bed**\". He also recommends V-8 juice as a healthy, cheap alternative to eating or soft drinks.\n\nHe persistently reiterates the importance of **believing in numbers over words** by highlighting human behavior discrepancies:\n*   Many claim to never buy by mail, yet mail order sales are in the billions. He jokes these are the same people who deny reading \"The National Enquirer\".\n*   In a USC class, students claimed to prefer plays over movies, but far more had seen a movie recently than a play.\n*   **The truth is determined by how people use their *wallet*, not their *mouth*.**. He urges Bond to be skeptical of what people say, surveys, and questionnaires, and instead **\"believe in numbers!\"**. \"If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck - guess what? It's probably a duck!\".\n\nHe advises staying aware by regularly consulting the SRDS book, monitoring hot mail order publications and ads, getting on mailing lists, and observing offers received. This cultivates a \"sixth sense\" for overlooked marketing opportunities.\n\nGary shares his belief that significant money can be made by targeting people at **\"emotional turning points\"** in their lives (e.g., new baby, marriage, job raise, bankruptcy, new car). He illustrates this by discovering a list of 120,000 new pregnant mothers monthly in SRDS. He outlines a hypothetical promotion for a report titled \"How To Raise Your Child's IQ Before It Is Even Born!\", calculating a potential profit of **$58,200 EVERY MONTH** from a 5% response rate on 120,000 names, after deducting fulfillment and mailing costs.\n\n### Chapter 9\n\n**Date:** Wednesday, June 20, 1984.\n\nGary starts by acknowledging he often writes without a clear direction, trusting that the writing process itself will provide guidance. He reminds Bond that even \"less responsive lists,\" like names from a phone book, can be valuable, citing his successful \"coat-of-arms promotion\" as an example.\n\nHe discusses **how to think about developing a mail order campaign**, emphasizing continued study of the SRDS list book and mail order advertising. He shares a new idea from reviewing SRDS's \"compiled lists\" (groups with common traits like professions or business types). His idea: take a general headline like \"How You Can Make Extra Money\" and **customize it for specific groups** (e.g., \"How Architects Can Make Extra Money,\" \"How Chiropractors Can Make Extra Money\"). The product would be a report with general money-making techniques and a customized section unique to that group. He even calls chiropractors \"greedy\" and suggests them as good targets.\n\nHe provides an example letter opening for a chiropractor, showing how the **personalized salutation and customized offer (\"doctors of chiropractic to make a great deal of extra money\")** immediately grab attention. He calculates the potential profit for such an offer to chiropractors: from a 4% response on 33,000 names, he estimates a **net profit of $9,920.00** after mailing and fulfillment costs.\n\nThis profit, while \"not a fortune,\" represents a **\"winning formula\"**. The strategy is to keep the general part of the report the same and only customize the last third for different groups, leading to \"Mucho bucks!\". He stresses that the **more \"custom tailored\" your promotion is, the more successful it will be**. He demonstrates this with examples of generic \"Dear Occupant\" vs. personalized and customized letters (\"Dear Bond, Here is a great new way for 16 year old kids to make money!\"). He also shows how a general real estate headline (\"How To Buy Real Estate With No Money Down\") improves by **customizing it for a specific location** (\"How To Buy L.A. Real Estate With No Money Down\"), which he confirms worked much better in practice. He concludes that \"Ideas breed other ideas,\" suggesting even further double customization (e.g., \"How a cardiologist can buy L.A. real estate\").\n\n### Chapter 10\n\n**Date:** Thursday, June 21, 1984.\n\nGary starts the letter without a clear plan, noting that his previous day's writing also started this way but produced \"something excellent\". He emphasizes the lesson: **when feeling stuck or \"emotionally jammed up,\" the way to get \"unclogged and flowing again is just to keep moving.\"** This can be physical (running, walking, jogging) or mental (writing, doing chores). **\"The key is movement!\"**.\n\nHe assumes Bond is consistently following his health and market research advice and then moves to **how to create an ad or direct mail promotion from scratch**.\nHe recommends getting and reading two classic marketing books multiple times:\n*   **\"Scientific Advertising\" by Claude Hopkins (3 times)**.\n*   **\"The Robert Collier Letter Book\" by Robert Collier (2 times)**.\nThe first reading is for enjoyment, subsequent readings are for taking notes. Additionally, Bond should read Gary's \"2001 Headlines\" and Ben Suarez's \"SuperBiz\" headlines, and create a \"swipe file\" of good ads and DM pieces, reading them and taking notes.\n\nGary outlines a **5-step process for creating a DM promotion:**\n1.  **Step 1: Find a suitable mailing list** in the SRDS book.\n2.  **Step 2: Read and take notes from hot books on the chosen topic** (e.g., real estate investing) relevant to the list.\n3.  **Step 3: Collect and take notes from existing DM pieces and space ads** on the same topic.\n4.  **Step 4: Review notes from Collier, Hopkins, and headlines.** A \"central selling idea\" should emerge. This idea should personalize and customize the offer (e.g., how to buy real estate in *his area* with no money down). He shows an example of a letter opening customized by location (\"to buy L.A. real estate,\" \"to buy Detroit real estate\"). He then demonstrates **\"double customization\"** by targeting both location *and* occupation (e.g., \"How for a cardiologist to buy L.A. real estate\").\n5.  **Step 5: Create the product.** This involves outlining the best ideas from read books, adding one's own ideas, arranging them logically, and writing a report (around 100 typewritten pages). This process, if done properly, creates a valuable \"tight informative roadmap\". He even comes up with a working title: \"The Amazing L.A. Roadmap To Real Estate Riches!\".\n\n### Chapter 11\n\n**Date:** Friday, June 22, 1984.\n\nGary focuses on the **creation of a direct mail promotion, starting with the outside envelope**, which he says is where most mailers fail. He explains that most mailers use \"teaser copy\" and design envelopes that are obviously commercial.\n\nHe introduces his **\"A-Pile, B-Pile\" lecture**:\n*   Everyone divides their daily mail into two piles:\n    *   **A-Pile:** Contains mail that appears personal (from friends, relatives, business associates). **This mail is *always* opened**.\n    *   **B-Pile:** Contains envelopes that are obviously commercial (with company names, bulk rate indicia, teaser copy). B-Pile mail is often thrown away unopened, or set aside and only *maybe* opened if the recipient is bored or has idle time.\n*   **The objective is to get your envelope into the \"A-Pile\"** by making it look personal, or at least non-commercial.\n\nHe then details the **ideal \"A-Pile\" envelope design**:\n*   **Corner card:** Only a return address, **no company name**.\n*   **Stamp:** Use an **\"honest-to-God live 1st class stamp (20¢)\"**.\n*   **Address:** A **handwritten or typed address; no label**.\nThis design ensures nearly everyone will open it because it's intriguing and looks personal. He criticizes that this \"obvious\" secret is missed by \"almost every advertising agency and nearly every so-called 'direct mail expert'\".\n\nNext, he moves to **getting the potential customer to *start* reading the sales letter**. He suggests using an \"attention grabber\" like attaching a **small plastic baggie filled with dirt** to the top of the letter. This physical grabber immediately captures \"focused attention,\" making the reader curious (\"What's in this baggie?\" \"Why dirt?\") and compelling them to read to find out. He also notes the importance of placing the typed day, date, and time above the salutation.\n\n**Insights from Bond (Postscript):**\n*   This is indeed Gary's famous A-Pile, B-Pile speech.\n*   Gary **never used \"teaser copy\"** because it immediately signals \"junk mail\" (\"oh yuck\" factor). Instead, he used \"First Class\" or \"Personal\" in red ink for higher-priced promotions or when mail screeners were involved, sometimes even using FedEx or a courier.\n*   Gary frequently used physical \"grabbers\" like coins or betting slips, and Bond inherited Iraqi money intended for this purpose.\n*   Bond notes that at this point, Gary was visibly transforming into a \"fit, focused and fearless human being,\" nearing his peak performance.\n\n### Chapter 12\n\n**Date:** Saturday, June 23, 1984.\n\nGary continues discussing the real estate letter, explaining the specific details on the first page. He elaborates on including the **day of the week, exact time, day of the month, and year**. This makes the letter feel more personal, creating a \"bond of intimacy and immediacy\" between writer and reader, much like a telegram. He also suggests describing your current location and activity (e.g., \"sitting cross-legged on my back here in room 7 of dorm 6 in the Boron Federal Prison Camp\") to further strengthen this bond.\n\nHe emphasizes the **personalization of the salutation, using the recipient's name (\"Dear Mr. Jones\" or \"Dear Bond\")** rather than generic greetings like \"Dear Sir\" or \"Dear Occupant\". This ensures the reader knows the letter is specifically for them, leading to greater attention.\n\nGary then reveals another small but crucial detail: including tiny instructions like **\"(over)\" or \"(go to page 7)\"** in the lower right-hand corner. This \"takes the reader by the hand\" and guides them through the letter, making it \"pleasant, easy-read, interesting and unconfusing,\" especially since prospects are often busy or distracted.\n\nHe moves on to **reply envelopes**, stating they must be included. He outlines three choices:\n1.  **SRE (Stamped Reply Envelope):** Reader pays postage.\n    *   **Disadvantage:** Cost (e.g., $200 per thousand at 20¢ stamp).\n    *   **When to test:** For **high-ticket items** where one or two extra sales cover the stamp cost. Also, to **induce guilt**, especially for charity letters (\"...I have even gone to the expense of putting a stamp on it so you won't have to hunt for one!\"). He explains that getting someone to mentally agree to write \"No\" can sometimes lead them to order instead, once they have pen and paper in hand.\n2.  **BRE (Business Reply Envelope):** Mailer pays postage only on returned envelopes.\n    *   **Advantages:** Convenient for customer, cheaper than SRE.\n    *   **Disadvantages:** **Slows mail/cash flow** (due to Post Office tabulation) and, critically, **immediately \"telegraphs\" that the letter is commercial**, causing many recipients to dismiss it without reading the pitch. This prevents them from discovering the genuine value of the offer. Also, cannot effectively induce guilt.\n3.  **PSH (Place Stamp Here) Envelope:** Customer pays postage.\n    *   **Advantages:** Most economical, and more personal than a BRE.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Gary judges this as the **\"best envelope for most mailers to use\"** because it balances cost and personalization, and many mailers would be surprised by the results if they tested it.\n\n**Insights from Bond (Postscript):**\n*   Bond notes that technology (computers) has largely mitigated the BRE delay issues since this letter was written.\n*   He points out that while reply envelopes remain important, **phone and internet ordering are becoming preferred methods, as \"in sales, delay is death.\"**.\n*   Bond also reveals Gary's tactic of hiding BREs in an inner envelope marked \"Do not open until you have read my letter\".\n*   Bond emphasizes the personal significance of Gary's detailed descriptions of his writing location, which inspired Bond to do the same for his own children, highlighting their mutual affection.\n\n### Chapter 13\n\n**Date:** Sunday, June 24, 1984.\n\nGary describes writing from a \"hideaway\" on \"The Hill\" in Camp Boron. He points out that he is already implementing the \"little ideas\" from yesterday's lesson in this very letter, such as personal details and immediacy.\n\nHe shares his emotional struggle after a call with Bond's mom, who feels alone and pressured by financial demands. This \"put some pain in my brain\". He recalls Bond's insightful comment that he is \"luckier than Jeff\" because he gets to see Gary solve problems while not rich. Despite wanting to snivel, take drugs, or just rest (and it being his fast day), he chooses to \"keep moving in some sort of positive direction\" because he **\"need[s] to,\"** emphasizing that this is a \"very very simple (but effective) thing to do\" when things are tough.\n\nGary reiterates how to use an **SRE (Stamped Reply Envelope) to induce guilt in a commercial sales pitch**. He provides a specific example for a \"legalized Nevada whorehouse\" offer, asking recipients to reply even if they can't participate, to free up the limited offer for someone else. The stamped envelope \"credentials\" the limited offer. He also explains a psychological trick: getting a person to agree to write \"No\" can sometimes lead them to decide to order instead, simply because they have a pen and paper in hand.\n\nHe then revisits **BREs (Business Reply Envelopes)**, highlighting their disadvantages: slowing mail/cash flow and, most importantly, **immediately telegraphing a commercial message**, which often leads recipients to discard the letter without reading the full pitch. He stresses that this is a disservice to the recipient if the offer has genuine value. Finally, he reaffirms that the **PSH (Place Stamp Here) envelope** is generally the **best option for most mailers**, being more economical than SREs and more personal than BREs.\n\n**Insights from Bond (Postscript):**\n*   Bond emphasizes the profound personal connection he feels from Gary's detailed descriptions of his writing environment, inspiring him to do the same for his own children. He shares that he visited the now-abandoned Boron prison camp and walked the very hill his father describes. He also highlights the mutual affection and closeness between him and his father.\n\n### Chapter 14\n\n**Date:** Monday, June 25, 1984.\n\nGary begins by stressing that **attention grabbers in advertisements and sales letters must be \"relevant,\" tie into the message, and \"make sense\"**. He warns against \"cheap shots,\" such as a misleading headline like \"A Submarine That Flies?\" that then admits it's not actually about a flying submarine. Such fraud makes people resentful and should be avoided; attention *can* be grabbed without \"cheating\".\n\nHe then uses the example of the **dirt-filled baggie** (from previous chapters) as a relevant attention grabber for a real estate offer. The letter begins by explaining the baggie's purpose: to get attention for a serious message, and that the dirt itself is a \"passport to complete financial independence\" because it represents **\"the most valuable thing on earth,\" which is real estate, specifically Hawaiian Real Estate from Maui**. This logically connects the physical grabber to the sales message. He emphasizes using words to make the reader \"picture with pleasure\" the scene, engaging their senses (e.g., feeling sand, smelling salt air).\n\nGary transitions to the crucial point of **order card and brochure placement**. He warns **against letting the reader see the order card or brochure immediately** upon opening the envelope. The reason is that many readers will jump straight to the order coupon to \"see what the deal is\" before reading the sales letter, which is undesirable. The order card should be seen at the **\"proper time,\" which is *after* the sales letter has been read**.\n\nHe reveals his **\"secret\" for temporarily hiding enclosures**: take an 8.5x11 piece of paper, cut it in half lengthwise, and fold it into thirds. On the back, write a handwritten note in blue ink: **\"NOTE: Open this paper to find the special info mentioned in my letter. GH\"**. This note, which refers back to the main letter and is personalized, intrigues the reader to finish the letter first. When opened at the appropriate time, this insert then reveals a boxed photo and the order coupon.\n\nFinally, he explains that while letters should be personal, they should also be \"**businesslike personal**\". Incorporating typeset elements and photographs adds an \"air of stability\" to the promotion, making it seem like a \"real business\" and credentialing the offer. Again, these elements should be seen **\"AFTER HE HAS READ OUR LETTER!\"**.\n\n**Insights from Bond (Postscript):**\n*   Bond notes that while the letter's advice about BRE delays is less relevant due to computer advancements, the core principle of minimizing \"delay\" is still crucial. He highlights that \"in sales, delay is death,\" preferring phone and internet orders which are immediate.\n*   He also reveals Gary's specific tactic of hiding enclosures in an envelope explicitly marked \"Do not open until you have read my letter,\" often containing an order coupon.\n\n### Chapter 15\n\n**Date:** Tuesday, June 26, 1984.\n\nGary wishes Bond a Happy Birthday and expresses pride in him. He shifts from the \"conceptualization\" of marketing to the **\"particulars of how to write copy\"**.\n\nThe first step in writing copy is to **assemble a comprehensive \"file\" of relevant materials**. This file should include:\n*   List cards for targeted mailing lists.\n*   A copy of the product report to be sold.\n*   Copies of successful direct mail pieces and space ads for related products or services by others.\n*   Books and reports on the topic (e.g., real estate investing).\n*   **\"Exceptionally good ads and DM pieces, even if they are not related to real estate\"**.\n*   His \"2001 Headlines\" book.\n*   Any other \"idea generator\" material.\n\nOnce assembled, Bond should read everything and take notes using Gary's **\"nugget notes\" technique**. These notes can be single words, meaningless phrases, or sensible observations, without worrying about perfection—just keep writing what comes to mind. **Always include a complete description of the product and, critically, notes on what the product will *do* for the customer (the benefits)**, such as making them wealthy, enabling them to buy a better car, or affording vacations. After taking notes, he advises rating them with stars (* for good, ** for better, *** for \"red hot\").\n\nA key \"quirk\" of his process is the **\"Aha Experience\"**: **after taking notes, Bond must \"STOP working on this project. That's right. Just let it go. Put it right out of your mind\" for a day or two**. During this break, an \"outstanding sales idea\" will often spontaneously occur, whether it's an attention grabber (like the baggie), a new way to visualize benefits, or a fresh sales point.\n\nOnce the breakthrough idea emerges, the next step is to **write the letter \"according to formula,\" specifically using the AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) sequential outline**.\n*   **A - Attention:** First, get the reader's attention.\n*   **I - Interest:** Second, get him interested.\n*   **D - Desire:** Third, make him desire what you are selling.\n*   **A - Action:** Finally, compel him to take the necessary action to get the product.\nHe promises to elaborate on AIDA in the next letter. The chapter ends with a brief mention of a prison search, highlighting the realities of his environment.\n\n### Chapter 16\n\n**Date:** Wednesday, June 27, 1984.\n\nGary elaborates on the **AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) formula** for writing sales letters:\n*   **Attention (A):** This is **CRUCIAL**; without it, the letter won't be read. He advocates attaching physical objects to letters (coins, dollar bills, foreign currency) as \"gimmicks\" to grab attention. However, he stresses getting the **\"right kind of attention\"** by ensuring the grabber is **relevant** and ties in naturally with the letter's story, avoiding insults or angering the reader (e.g., the dirt baggie for real estate).\n*   **Interest (I):** After capturing attention and making the relevant tie-in, the next step is to catch the reader's interest by **\"feeding him interesting facts\"**. For a Maui real estate offer, this would include facts about potential money to be made, the beach's size, its investment opportunity, and even details like pretty girls or fish.\n*   **Desire (D):** To arouse desire, Gary advises **describing the *benefits* the prospect will receive** if they buy the product or service. For an investment offer, the main attraction is making money. He emphasizes helping the prospect **\"picture in his mind the benefits of having more money,\"** reminding Bond to \"always do even the obvious\". Examples of such benefits include a new car (comfort, luxury, status), a nice house, peace of mind (no worries), vacations, attracting the opposite sex, and leisure time.\n*   **Action (A):** The final step is to **compel the prospect to take action** (i.e., send an order). Gary notes his thoroughness in closing sales, sometimes dedicating 25% or more of an ad to this. He instructs to be **\"very clear, very specific\"** and **\"lead him by the hand\"**. This includes telling the reader exactly where the order coupon is, how to fill it out, how much to send, who to make payments to, how to use the envelope (and if a stamp is needed), and crucially, to **\"do all this *RIGHT NOW!* *TODAY!*\"**. He also advises telling the reader what they will *gain* by hurrying and what they will *lose* by delaying.\n\nAs an assignment, Gary asks Bond to **copy the Tova \"facelift ad\" in his own handwriting** as if preparing it for a secretarial service, promising to explain the reason later. The chapter ends with Gary congratulating Bond on getting his driver's license.\n\n### Chapter 17\n\n**Date:** Thursday, June 28, 1984.\n\nGary explains the purpose behind his assignment to **copy successful ads and direct mail pieces in one's own handwriting for several months**: When you physically write out a good ad, \"the words and the flow and the sentence structure and the sequence of information and everything else about the writing of that ad **becomes a part of you**\". This is an \"internal imprinting\" on your mind and body that develops a deep \"inside out\" understanding of good copywriting. He considers this a vital \"discipline that other lazy 'would be' marketing geniuses will not suffer,\" giving those who do it a significant advantage.\n\nHe illustrates this with the example of **Arthur Haley, author of \"Roots,\"** who copied great books by hand to become a master writer. Haley also immersed himself in his subject matter by personally experiencing the miserable conditions of ocean travel for his book, demonstrating the importance of deep, \"cellular\" knowledge.\n\nGary provides a list of **\"killer\" promotions** for Bond to copy, including the Tova Ad, \"How To Burn Off Body Fat Hour By Hour,\" \"The Beverly Hills Diamond Ad,\" and \"The Original Family Coat-Of-Arms Letter\".\n\nHe then offers several tips for **writing good copy (or \"good anything\")**:\n*   Use **simple, common, everyday words** (e.g., \"get\" instead of \"procure\").\n*   Write **short sentences and short paragraphs**.\n*   Employ **\"transition\" words and phrases** to ensure smooth flow (e.g., \"Well, as a matter of fact,\" \"Now, naturally,\" \"And, of course\").\n*   **Ask questions and then answer them yourself** to engage the reader (\"Bond, do you understand...? You do. Good, then let's go on.\").\n*   **Good writing makes things \"perfectly clear,\" easy to understand, and easy to keep reading**. He recommends Kurt Vonnegut's \"Breakfast of Champions\" for clarity.\n*   **One-word transition sentences like \"Onward.\"** also aid flow.\n\nHe concludes on writing philosophy: **\"The Best Way To Become A Good Writer... Is By... Writing Good Writing!\"**. He advises against worrying about developing a \"style,\" as it will emerge naturally. Critically, **\"The very best writing goes unnoticed.\"** You don't want readers to praise your writing style; you want them to **\"order from your ad.\"**. He warns: **\"If you are writing for applause... you will go home with empty pockets!\" Write for *money*!\"**.\n\nFinally, he suggests using **\"word pictures\"** to help readers vicariously experience the benefits of a product (e.g., describing a jacuzzi's soothing water or the aroma of steaks). He also notes the **\"judicious use of parentheses\"** for \"eye relief,\" making copy easier to read and understand.\n\n### Chapter 18\n\n**Date:** Friday, June 29, 1984.\n\nGary delves deeper into **\"eye relief\" and the importance of ad layout**. He notes that people often avoid reading text that looks \"forbidding\" due to long sentences, long paragraphs, narrow margins, small type, and little white space. He stresses that copy should appear **\"inviting to read,\" \"easy-to-read,\" and an \"attractive 'eye treat'\"**. This means using **wide margins, white space, double spacing between paragraphs, short words, short sentences, and short paragraphs**.\n\nHe then reveals one of his **\"very most important secrets,\"** claiming it can increase readership by as much as 500% yet remains \"virtually unknown\" by most advertising professionals. The secret is: **\"The Layout Of Your Advertisement Should Catch The Attention Of Your Reader... But... Not In A Way That Causes Him To 'Notice' The Layout!\"**. He explains that editorial content in publications gets five times more readership than advertising. Therefore, **your ads should, \"as much as possible, have an 'editorial look' about them,\" specifically like an \"exciting piece of editorial material\" or a \"rave review written by a reporter\"**. This includes the look of an \"exciting news flash\". He suggests studying editorial layouts, not just ad layouts.\n\nApplying this to direct mail, he advises that DM letters should resemble a personal, enthusiastic letter from a reporter to a friend, perhaps including a snapshot of the product. He provides a powerful example with his **\"Family Name Research Report\" letter (the Coat-of-Arms letter)**, which initially generated over 7 million cash-with-order customers with a single-page, 361-word letter. Subsequent professional-looking catalogs and brochures bombed. However, when he returned to a **\"very personal sales letter\" enclosing a *snapshot* of the best-selling item**, it generated **$40 Million!**.\n\nThe moral of this story is profound: **\"YOU CAN DO A BETTER SELLING JOB WHEN AT FIRST IT DOES NOT APPEAR YOU ARE ATTEMPTING TO DO A SALES JOB.\"**. He closes by foreshadowing his next topic: \"You Never Get A Second Chance To Make A First Impression!\".\n\n### Chapter 19\n\n**Date:** Saturday, June 30, 1984.\n\nGary introduces the core subject: **\"You Never Get A Second Chance To Make A First Impression.\"** He illustrates this with several examples:\n*   Job interviewers decide within the first **40 seconds**.\n*   Jury members make up their minds during the first **half-hour** of a trial.\n*   Love happens \"almost instantaneously\".\n*   A reader is \"hooked or lose[d]... when he very first *looks* at your ad or DM piece,\" **not when he reads it**.\n\nHe clarifies that while exceptions exist, **most people will never alter their initial impression**, instead \"edit[ing]\" new information to validate their original opinion.\n\nThe implication for advertising is that your ad or direct mail piece should instantly give the prospect a \"lift\" and cause their pupils to dilate (an involuntary reaction to seeing something liked). Gary theorizes that many decisions are made in the **\"first fraction of a second\"** of seeing something new, with the rest of \"decision making time\" spent **\"searching for justification for the decision we have *already made*.\"**. Therefore, the \"sale\" or \"no sale\" decision is largely made the **instant a prospect sees your ad and reads your headline**. If they get an \"instant 'lift',\" they will start reading, *looking for reasons to convince themselves the ad's promise is true*.\n\nTo achieve this \"lift,\" promotions need a \"**crisp' look**\" – clean layout, strong contrast, and inviting readability. Pictures should be upbeat (e.g., \"after\" photos). He also notes that women prefer pictures of women in ads, and men prefer men.\n\nFor direct mail, he provides specific enhancements for a \"lift\":\n*   Use **good, crisp white paper** for letters and envelopes.\n*   If using labels, use **tight white labels on matching envelopes**.\n*   Use **large, colorful commemorative stamps** whenever practical.\n*   Dignified, non-distracting letterhead.\n*   Serif typeface, typed with a carbon ribbon for clarity.\n*   If using a second color for underlining, use **RED**.\n*   Photographs/simulated photos should be **crisp, clean, glossy, and clear**, not \"cheap, limp and soggy\". These rules apply to all enclosures.\n\n### Chapter 20\n\n**Date:** Sunday, July 1, 1984.\n\nGary reflects on Dennis Haslinger's advice that most serious mistakes are \"bad ego decisions,\" which Gary has found true in his life regarding women, money, and physical danger. He recounts a recent prison confrontation where a roommate yelled at him over loud radio use and threatened him. Despite his desire to explain or \"run a 'macho trip,'\" Gary **remained silent, \"eating a little humble pie,\"** believing it was the right decision despite feeling cowardly.\n\nHe explains his reasons for not escalating:\n*   **Physical danger:** The roommate was also physical and experienced in prison workouts.\n*   **Risk of harming the roommate:** Gary is also physically capable.\n*   **Severe consequences:** A fight would lead to transfer to a higher-security prison and loss of \"good time,\" potentially adding six months to his sentence.\nGary then asserts that **\"everything in this letter has a lot to do with creating better ads and DM pieces!\"**.\n\nHe connects his actions to a broader principle: by staying in the room, working on his letter (even with shaky handwriting from adrenaline), planning his schedule, and doing road work, he is **\"clearing the deck\" and getting emotional \"garbage out of my system\" so his strategic decisions, future letters, and ideas will be clear**.\n\nHe introduces the acronym **HALT: Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired.** His crucial advice: **\"you should never make a decision when you are any of those things.\"**. Instead, do what he did: write, run, walk, talk, or jog, but choose who you communicate with carefully, as the **\"process\" or \"physical act\" of these activities *is* the therapy, not necessarily the content**. The key principle is: **\"You Don't Have To Get It Right... You Just Have To Get It MOVING!\"**.\n\nHe contrasts this incident with another in prison where he had to directly confront a loud, strong inmate who snatched his pool cue. In that instance, Gary got \"eyeball to eyeball\" and firmly took his stick back, demonstrating his ability to *be* tough when genuinely necessary.\n\n### Chapter 21\n\n**Date:** Monday, July 2, 1984.\n\nGary discusses **\"propositions,\" which are the \"deal\" you offer** in direct mail and mail order selling. Examples include buy-one-get-one-free, book club models (many items for a low price with a commitment to buy more later), or discounts for immediate or bulk purchases. The most common proposition is simply exchanging product for money.\n\nA very important ingredient for making propositions work is the **\"reason why\"**. If you offer a good deal without an explanation, it won't be believable. Common \"reasons why\" for deals include: going out of business, a fire sale, owing taxes, losing a lease, or needing to make space for new merchandise.\n\nGary takes a detour to emphasize using more **powerful, visceral language** in copy. Instead of \"dramatically increase your sales volume,\" he suggests \"make yourself a bushel of money!\". He advises: **\"Bring your story down to earth and hit 'em where they live. (In their hearts and their pocketbooks!)\"**.\n\nHe shares his personal hurt over his ex-girlfriend seeing someone new while he's in prison, and describes his coping mechanism: **\"I Just Keep On Keepin' On.\"** He deals with the pain by writing, doing road work and chores, and avoiding sniveling. He believes one cannot always control what happens, but has control over their responses.\n\nHe then introduces the **\"far more compelling 'excuse for a deal'\": \"I Am Offering You This Deal Because You (By Virtue Of Some Unique Circumstance) Are So Special.\"**. He revisits the **Family Crest Wall Plaque example**, explaining how he leveraged the unique circumstance of having a specific family's crest plaque in stock (used for publicity photos) to offer it at a \"true and honest discount\" to someone with that specific family name. This approach generated an astounding **$40 Million in Sales!**.\n\nHe provides other examples of using this \"you are special\" approach: offering a car because a customer wants that specific trade-in, offering unique art to an \"astute judge of art\" for their opinion, or contacting someone because a mutual friend said they were the \"best judge of value\" for a book. He also gives examples of attention-grabbing openings using this principle, such as attaching a dollar bill with a message for \"every other real estate agent in L.A. County,\" or highlighting the rarity of a family name.\n\n### Chapter 22\n\n**Date:** Tuesday, July 3, 1984.\n\nGary introduces a \"little trick\" to improve copywriting: **\"read your copy out loud.\"**. When read aloud, you'll \"verbally stumble over all the places that are not smooth,\" revealing awkward phrasing or flow issues. The solution is to rewrite those rough spots and repeat the process until the copy flows perfectly \"without a bump or a bubble\". He considers advertising writing \"the best writing of all\". He connects this to his earlier advice: reading *other people's* good ads and DM pieces aloud *and* copying them by hand will \"internally imprinting on your nerves, muscle fibers, brain cells and every fiber of your being\" the process of good writing.\n\nHe then outlines the **business process of mail order \"deals\"** he puts together with his \"bankers\" (investors):\n1.  **Find a hot mailing list** in the SRDS book.\n2.  **Find or create a product to sell to that list**, preferably \"paper and ink\" (written reports that solve problems). He lists past successful report titles like \"How To Raise Your Child's I.Q. Before It Is Even Born!\" and \"How To Collect From Social Security At Any Age!\" (which made him $800,000).\n3.  **Discuss the project with a \"banker\"** who, if interested, provides about $5,000 to cover product development, test names, and test mailing costs.\n4.  He creates the DM promotion and mails it.\n5.  **Analyze results:** It will be a loser, a winner, or marginal.\n    *   **Loser:** Banker loses $5,000.\n    *   **Winner:** Banker invests another $50,000 for a 100,000-piece mailing, with subsequent mailings financed by cash flow, and profits split 50/50.\n    *   **Marginal:** They decide whether to risk another $5,000 for a retest.\nThis, he says, is a \"nice simple way of doing business\".\n\nHe then provides a concise **outline of the steps to direct mail success**:\n1.  Find a hot market (mailing list).\n2.  Find or create a product (preferably paper and ink) for that market.\n3.  Create a direct mail promotion describing the product and its benefits.\n4.  Make a test mailing (1,000-5,000 pieces).\n5.  Analyze results.\n6.  If good, mail 20,000-100,000 more letters.\n7.  If still good, start rolling out and taking care of business.\nHe emphasizes that it's a simple procedure with excellent chances of success if common sense is used.\n\nGary then highlights the **most common mistake leading to MO \u0026 DM failure**: **\"finding or developing a product *FIRST* and then looking for a market to sell it to.\"** He declares this \"backasswards\" and states: **\"You Must Always Find A Market *First*... And *Then* Concentrate On A Product!\"**. He concludes that products are \"a dime a dozen\" and less crucial than finding a hot market, because a hot market will *always* have a product to fill its needs.\n\n### Chapter 23\n\n**Date:** Wednesday, July 4, 1984.\n\nDespite the 114-degree heat, fasting, and being in prison, Gary lists his ongoing productive activities: roadwork, ad changes, letters, and maintaining relationships. He uses this to **\"give you some guilt\"** (to Bond) because Bond admitted to not doing his roadwork. Gary powerfully states: **\"It doesn't matter *how much* you learn if you don't *use* what you learn.\"**. He urges Bond to \"just do it\" and \"KEEP ON KEEPING ON,\" reminding him of his own challenging circumstances in prison.\n\nHe discusses a key differentiator between successful people and those who are not: **\"awareness.\"**. Most people are \"lost in a fog,\" easily \"shorn\" like sheep. In prison (a microcosm of society), one must be **\"alert, on top of things and ready at any time to 'catch a break'\"**. Inmates who succeed take care of themselves: exercise, grooming, reading, and studying.\n\nThis awareness applies directly to business: fortunes are made by those who are **\"on top of things\" in their fields**. They:\n*   Stay up to date and read trade journals.\n*   Are on competitors' mailing lists.\n*   Read \"HOT\" mail order publications.\n*   Keep their \"SWIPE FILE\" current.\n*   Read classic books by field experts.\n*   Maintain \"idea files\" (newspaper articles, unusual info, layouts, propositions).\n*   Communicate regularly with industry leaders.\nGary attributes his reputation as an \"advertising genius\" to one overlooked reason: **\"I Work Like Crazy!\"**. He uses a poker analogy: while everyone is dealt similar hands, **winners are determined by *how they play* those cards** – exploiting good hands, dumping bad ones, and adapting mediocre ones. He also stresses the importance of \"**sweat[ing] the details**\".\n\nFinally, Gary addresses **believability in promotions**, stating that giving **exact details** increases it. Instead of vague statements, use specifics like \"77.6% of all car owners\" or exact weight loss figures. He notes that small, seemingly irrelevant details (like mentioning his \"blue\" bandanna) draw the reader closer and make the communication \"more real\" and believable, provided they don't distract from the message itself. He also links awareness to knowing the time without a clock, suggesting a self-check for being \"on top of things\".\n\n### Chapter 24\n\n**Date:** Thursday, July 5, 1984.\n\nGary announces he will temporarily stop writing letters after tomorrow. His reasons are:\n1.  He needs to review reference material and outline future letters, as his current \"babblings\" are becoming too random.\n2.  Bond needs to get the first 25 letters typed up for his own review and note-taking.\n3.  Gary needs to catch up on other work, including filing a legal motion to modify his sentence and potentially get out earlier.\n4.  **He has \"bankers\" eager for him to develop new promotions that they will finance with a 50/50 profit split.**.\n\nHe intends for Bond to learn by **\"watch[ing] over my shoulder as I begin to create one profitable promotion after another\"**. He outlines his process:\n1.  Go through the SRDS book and identify \"hot markets\" (lists).\n2.  Review these lists with Eric for feedback.\n3.  Develop product ideas for the selected lists, welcoming Bond's input.\n4.  Codify projects and pitch them to his \"bankers\".\n5.  **Bankers' Investment:** If a banker is interested, they provide a **$5,000 \"development fee\"** to cover DM piece creation, a test mailing (2-5,000 names), and product development.\n6.  **Results:** If the test fails, the banker absorbs the $5,000 loss. If results are good, they proceed with a larger mailing (e.g., 50,000 pieces), and if still good, they \"start rolling out\".\nGary plans to keep Bond informed and even give him a \"small cut of the action\".\n\nHe then shifts to the subject of **\"IMPACT\" in direct mail promotions**. He notes that the average American is subjected to about 1,500 commercial messages daily, but few have \"appreciable impact\". His favorite way to achieve impact is by **\"attaching things to the top of my letters\"**.\n\nHe describes the **classic \"dollar bill\" letter** from \"The Robert Collier Letter Book\": a first-class letter for a children's hospital fundraiser that had a **real dollar bill attached**. The copy explained the writer's strategy of mailing 1,000 dollar bills, hoping recipients would return it with more of their own. This letter was \"probably the most effective direct mail promotion ever mailed,\" achieving **over 90% response and generating tens of millions of dollars.** \"That's Impact!\". He also mentions his successful Japanese \"Penny\" promotion, where a penny was attached as an attention-grabber relevant to the product's Japanese origin.\n\n**A crucial warning:** Whatever you attach must **\"tie in with the rest of your letter and what you are selling. It should make sense and fit into the promotion in a natural way.\"**. He illustrates **how *not* to use impact** with the example of \"traffic ticket\" ads placed on car windshields. While they grab attention and are remembered, they evoke **\"Distaste! He Will Remember That This Is A Company That Scared Him And Made Him Angry! No Sale!\"**. The message: \"You must not use 'cheap tricks'.\". He offers original examples of relevant attachments, such as an eagle feather for conservation or a Mexican Peso for inflation (which he used successfully).\n\n### Chapter 25\n\n**Date:** Friday, July 7, 1984.\n\nGary recounts a minor confrontation in the chow hall with an inmate he calls \"The Rodent\" over ice, where Gary chose to \"glare\" and walk away despite feeling he could have easily won a physical fight. He explains that both this incident and a previous one with his roommate occurred when he was **\"off\"** – meaning not at his best mentally or physically. **\"When I am off, when *anybody* is off, this is *communicated*!\"**. He was vulnerable from fasting twice, missing his girlfriend \"L,\" and generally feeling sad. In prison, his \"Karma\" (mental state) is especially critical, as it's \"a bad place to be weak, even a little and even momentarily\". Indicators of being \"off\" include being slightly clumsy or off on time (as noted in Chapter 23). He points out he was also suffering from **HALT (Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired)** when the incidents happened.\n\nHe admits that in both confrontations, he was \"wrong\" by not being \"aware and on top of things\". He failed to notice his radio was disturbing others or that \"The Rodent\" was deliberately rationing ice. While these might be minor issues on the street, in prison, there is \"a lot less slack\".\n\nHis strategy for dealing with being \"off\": **\"lay low for a while until I am feeling strong and not feeling vulnerable.\"**. This involves temporarily avoiding fellow inmates and adjusting his fasting schedule. He believes that if he had been \"pumped\" (physically strong and mentally sharp), these incidents wouldn't have happened because he would have been more alert and emitted different \"vibes\". Blurred vision is another personal indicator of stress for him.\n\nHe relates this to business success: **\"At the time in my life when I was making the most money, I followed the same procedure I am talking about here. Namely: I pay attention to myself and when I am off, I drop out of sight and do what is necessary to strengthen myself.\"**. This is vital because **\"People can smell it when you are weak. When you are vulnerable. They can smell success too. They can sniff out a winner. And you can't fake it. Not for long. You've got to *be* it!\"**.\n\nHe details his immediate plan to regain strength: not skipping running, even after fasting, and getting up early to run on Sunday. He shares finding a valuable friend in prison who gives similar advice (don't sink to their level, avoid cursing, exercise).\n\nAs this is the last of his first batch of letters, Gary expresses longing for freedom and acknowledges how precious \"the good times and the *good people* are\". He hopes to never again neglect his special relationships, particularly with Bond. He concludes with his resolve to **\"go underground\" and \"quietly strengthen myself,\" aiming to become an expert at \"quietly diffusing explosive situations and sending out stronger vibes\"** to prevent future negative encounters.","headings":[{"level":3,"text":"Chapter 1","id":"chapter-1"},{"level":3,"text":"Chapter 2","id":"chapter-2"},{"level":3,"text":"Chapter 3","id":"chapter-3"},{"level":3,"text":"Chapter 4","id":"chapter-4"},{"level":3,"text":"Chapter 5","id":"chapter-5"},{"level":3,"text":"Chapter 6","id":"chapter-6"},{"level":3,"text":"Chapter 7","id":"chapter-7"},{"level":3,"text":"Chapter 8","id":"chapter-8"},{"level":3,"text":"Chapter 9","id":"chapter-9"},{"level":3,"text":"Chapter 10","id":"chapter-10"},{"level":3,"text":"Chapter 11","id":"chapter-11"},{"level":3,"text":"Chapter 12","id":"chapter-12"},{"level":3,"text":"Chapter 13","id":"chapter-13"},{"level":3,"text":"Chapter 14","id":"chapter-14"},{"level":3,"text":"Chapter 15","id":"chapter-15"},{"level":3,"text":"Chapter 16","id":"chapter-16"},{"level":3,"text":"Chapter 17","id":"chapter-17"},{"level":3,"text":"Chapter 18","id":"chapter-18"},{"level":3,"text":"Chapter 19","id":"chapter-19"},{"level":3,"text":"Chapter 20","id":"chapter-20"},{"level":3,"text":"Chapter 21","id":"chapter-21"},{"level":3,"text":"Chapter 22","id":"chapter-22"},{"level":3,"text":"Chapter 23","id":"chapter-23"},{"level":3,"text":"Chapter 24","id":"chapter-24"},{"level":3,"text":"Chapter 25","id":"chapter-25"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/writings/[slug]","query":{"slug":"2025-03-03"},"buildId":"GTOE8DyREQ8Hi2UmknRkY","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
