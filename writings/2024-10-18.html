<p><em>October 17, 2024</em></p>
<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<p><strong>Dhirubhai Ambani was born to be a trader.</strong> His family belongs to the Bania caste, a group within the traditional Hindu social order associated with merchants and bankers. This gave him an automatic social network and expectations that made commerce a natural and honorable career choice.   Ambani&#x27;s family followed <strong>Vaishnavism</strong>, a branch of Hinduism popular in Gujarat that emphasizes devotion to Lord Vishnu. This philosophy gave a sense of purpose to their roles as providers and family members, fitting the rising social status of the Banias in the region.</p>
<p>Ambani&#x27;s <strong>father was a schoolteacher</strong> who lived a simple and austere life, earning very little.   The family lived in a small, two-roomed stone dwelling.   The <strong>Second World War had little impact</strong> on the region of Kathiawar, where Ambani grew up.</p>
<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<p>Ambani&#x27;s experience in <strong>Aden</strong>, Yemen, exposed him to a multicultural environment and provided valuable lessons in trading and navigating diverse social circles.   The <strong>Gujarati community in East Africa</strong> was known for its frugality and hard work.   They were successful migrants who accumulated wealth through rigorous saving and long working hours, often relying on the labor of unpaid family members.   This success, however, led to resentment from locals, resulting in their expulsion and the seizure of their assets after the colonies gained independence.   The <strong>Gujarati diaspora</strong> then spread worldwide, taking their commercial drive and skills with them.</p>
<p>Ambani&#x27;s <strong>early business practices</strong> in Bombay involved importing yarn and supplying it to textile mills. He was known for his <strong>competitive spirit</strong> and open approach to business dealings. His rivals acknowledged his ambition and determination.</p>
<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<p>Ambani&#x27;s early days in Bombay were marked by <strong>austere living conditions</strong>. He lived in a <strong>crowded, noisy, and dirty</strong> apartment with his wife and four children. These experiences shaped the <strong>ambition</strong> of his two sons, Mukesh and Anil, who later assumed leadership roles in Reliance Industries.</p>
<h1>Chapter 4</h1>
<p>Ambani&#x27;s textile business, <strong>Reliance Industries</strong>, experienced significant growth and success. He established a large factory in Naroda, employing a considerable workforce. Ambani introduced his own <strong>brand name, Vimal</strong>, and created a network of franchised shops to sell his products. He was recognized for his <strong>dynamic leadership</strong> and credited with the success of the Vimal brand. The appearance of snakes during the factory&#x27;s construction was seen as a <strong>good omen</strong>, further associating Ambani with fortune and success.</p>
<h1>Chapter 5</h1>
<p>Ambani&#x27;s success was attributed to his <strong>strategic cultivation of relationships</strong>, from low-level employees to high-ranking officials.   He had a <strong>remarkable memory for names and faces</strong>, and he believed in <strong>&quot;salaaming&quot; (bowing down to)</strong> anyone who could be helpful.   This approach was essential in navigating the bureaucratic hurdles of the &quot;<strong>Licence Raj</strong>,&quot; where government control over industries required businesses to secure approvals and licenses.</p>
<p>Ambani took advantage of <strong>loopholes and amendments</strong> in economic policies to benefit his business. He cultivated relationships with <strong>influential politicians</strong>, including Indira Gandhi&#x27;s private secretary, Yashpal Kapur, and his successor, R. K. Dhawan.</p>
<h1>Chapter 6</h1>
<p>Ambani positioned himself as an <strong>underdog</strong> fighting against the established business elite. He exploited the perception of an <strong>inner circle</strong> within the Licence Raj, highlighting the dominance of the Birla group, which had received a significant share of government-approved industrial investments. Ambani contrasted his outsider status with the Birla family&#x27;s long-standing political connections and their use of philanthropy to gain public favor.</p>
<p>Ambani secured financial support from institutions like the <strong>Syndicate Bank</strong> and the <strong>Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI)</strong>. He impressed these backers with his <strong>enthusiasm, clear business proposals, and knowledge of the market</strong>. Ambani&#x27;s commitment to using <strong>high-quality equipment and personnel</strong> further solidified their confidence in him. His <strong>strategic donations to educational institutions</strong> associated with his financial backers enhanced his reputation and strengthened these relationships.</p>
<h1>Chapter 7</h1>
<p>Ambani took advantage of the <strong>Higher Unit Value Scheme</strong>, which allowed businesses to import raw materials at low international prices and sell finished goods domestically at much higher prices. This scheme generated substantial profits for Reliance. He aggressively pursued <strong>export opportunities</strong>, focusing on markets like Poland and Saudi Arabia. To enhance his company&#x27;s image and export activities, Ambani used <strong>publicity stunts</strong> such as taking out full-page newspaper advertisements to announce charter flights carrying his products to foreign markets.</p>
<p>Ambani&#x27;s competitors accused him of exploiting the Higher Unit Value Scheme for personal gain. He defended himself by claiming that the scheme was available to all businesses and that his success was due to his entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
<h1>Chapter 8</h1>
<p>Ambani further expanded Reliance by venturing into the <strong>texturizing business</strong>, processing polyester fiber to enhance its qualities. His <strong>bold business maneuvers</strong> and ability to overcome challenges contributed to his growing reputation.   For example, when faced with rumors of financial troubles, Ambani publicly offered to repay any outstanding debts, demonstrating his confidence and silencing his critics.</p>
<p>He maintained a <strong>close relationship with influential figures</strong> in the government, such as T. A. Pai, who continued to support Reliance&#x27;s expansion.   Ambani often made remarks suggesting that he had taken <strong>unconventional measures</strong> to achieve his success, hinting at possible ethically questionable actions that remained hidden.</p>
<h1>Chapter 9</h1>
<p>Reliance continued its rapid growth by building a <strong>new polyester filament yarn (PFY) plant</strong> in Patalganga, Maharashtra. This ambitious project was completed in a remarkably short time, showcasing Ambani&#x27;s efficiency and determination. He capitalized on <strong>policy loopholes</strong> and exploited government regulations to secure advantages for Reliance.</p>
<h1>Chapter 10</h1>
<p>Ambani&#x27;s aggressive business practices led to <strong>conflicts</strong> with other players in the industry. He was accused of <strong>manipulating government policies</strong> to benefit Reliance at the expense of smaller competitors. For example, he advocated for <strong>anti-dumping duties</strong> on imported polyester yarn, which hurt smaller texturizing companies while giving Reliance a significant advantage in the market.</p>
<h1>Chapter 11</h1>
<p>Ambani cultivated a <strong>loyal investor base</strong> by promoting Reliance shares as a path to significant wealth. He fostered a sense of <strong>community</strong> among shareholders, referring to them as the <strong>&quot;Reliance family.&quot;</strong> Ambani&#x27;s <strong>financial strategies</strong> generated impressive returns for investors, further solidifying his reputation as a business genius.</p>
<h1>Chapter 12</h1>
<p>Ambani&#x27;s <strong>ambitious expansion plans</strong> involved moving further into the <strong>petrochemicals industry</strong>, aiming to produce a range of chemical products.   He continued to receive praise from analysts and commentators, who acknowledged his <strong>ability to foresee and capitalize on emerging market trends</strong>.  However, his success also attracted criticism and allegations of manipulation and unethical practices.</p>
<p>Ambani&#x27;s <strong>public image</strong> was marked by a <strong>combination of admiration and controversy</strong>. He was seen as a <strong>symbol of Gujarati entrepreneurial spirit</strong>, breaking through the barriers of established business communities. His willingness to <strong>bend rules and exploit loopholes</strong> was often rationalized as necessary tactics for an outsider to succeed.</p>
<h1>Chapter 13</h1>
<p>Behind Ambani&#x27;s public persona was a <strong>network of associates and companies</strong> engaged in <strong>manipulating share prices, influencing government policies, and controlling media narratives</strong>. Ambani maintained a complex system to ensure <strong>Reliance&#x27;s continued success</strong> and maintain a steady flow of public investment.</p>
<p>Ambani&#x27;s <strong>share price manipulation</strong> involved using a network of investment companies and friendly brokers to buy and sell Reliance shares, creating an illusion of high demand and driving up the price.   He exploited <strong>legal loopholes</strong> and operated in a regulatory environment that lacked explicit laws against insider trading.</p>
<h1>Chapter 14</h1>
<p>Ambani&#x27;s <strong>media strategy</strong> involved cultivating relationships with journalists and editors, using <strong>gifts, financial incentives, and advertising</strong> to influence coverage. He established a network of <strong>&quot;moles&quot;</strong> within the press to plant favorable stories and suppress negative ones.  Ambani&#x27;s approach to media management was a significant departure from the traditional cautiousness of Indian business leaders.</p>
<p>Ambani&#x27;s <strong>influence extended beyond reporters</strong> to desk editors and even newspaper owners. He used his <strong>financial power</strong> to silence critics and shape public perception of Reliance.   Ambani also used his media contacts to <strong>gather intelligence on competitors</strong> and spread rumors to undermine their businesses.</p>
<h1>Chapter 15</h1>
<p>The <strong>Great Polyester War</strong> was a fierce battle between Ambani and his rivals in the polyester industry, primarily <strong>Nusli Wadia of Bombay Dyeing</strong>. This conflict involved <strong>aggressive business tactics, political maneuvering, and media manipulation</strong>.</p>
<p>Ambani&#x27;s clash with Wadia escalated when <strong>V. P. Singh</strong>, then the Finance Minister, took steps to regulate the polyester industry, impacting Reliance&#x27;s profitability.  Ambani retaliated by using his influence to <strong>discredit Wadia</strong> and his company.</p>
<h1>Chapter 16</h1>
<p>Ambani&#x27;s relationship with <strong>Ramnath Goenka</strong>, owner of the <strong>Indian Express</strong> newspapers, soured when Goenka became aware of Ambani&#x27;s attempts to manipulate the press. Goenka, a powerful media figure, was offended by Ambani&#x27;s belief that everyone had a price. He decided to <strong>expose Ambani&#x27;s wrongdoings</strong>, leading to a sustained campaign of investigative journalism against Reliance.</p>
<p>Goenka tasked <strong>S. Gurumurthy</strong>, a young accountant, with uncovering Reliance&#x27;s secrets.  Gurumurthy&#x27;s investigations, published in the Indian Express, revealed a complex web of financial manipulations, questionable business practices, and potential legal violations.</p>
<h1>Chapter 17</h1>
<p>Gurumurthy&#x27;s articles focused on Reliance&#x27;s <strong>exploitation of loopholes</strong> in government regulations, particularly relating to <strong>non-convertible debentures</strong> and investments by <strong>non-resident Indians (NRIs)</strong>. He argued that Reliance&#x27;s actions distorted financial markets and potentially facilitated the outflow of capital from India.</p>
<p>Gurumurthy continued his investigation, raising concerns about Reliance&#x27;s <strong>import practices</strong>, alleging potential <strong>smuggling</strong> of equipment and materials. He suggested that Reliance exerted undue influence over government decision-making processes.</p>
<h1>Chapter 18</h1>
<p>Gurumurthy&#x27;s exposé, titled <strong>&quot;Reliance Loan Maha mela,&quot;</strong> revealed Reliance&#x27;s alleged use of <strong>loans from banks</strong> to manipulate share prices and gain control of other companies. His investigation uncovered a network of <strong>front companies</strong> and questionable financial transactions.</p>
<h1>Chapter 19</h1>
<p>Gurumurthy&#x27;s efforts to trace the <strong>ownership of Reliance shares</strong> held through offshore companies led him to <strong>Panama and Dubai</strong>, uncovering a complex network of shell companies and nominee shareholders. His investigations suggested that Reliance might be using these offshore structures to obscure the true ownership of shares and potentially evade taxes.</p>
<p>Gurumurthy&#x27;s findings reignited the controversy surrounding Reliance&#x27;s acquisition of shares by companies based in the <strong>Isle of Man</strong>, raising suspicions about the legitimacy of these investments and their compliance with Indian regulations.</p>
<h1>Chapter 20</h1>
<p>Gurumurthy&#x27;s investigation into Reliance&#x27;s finances revealed <strong>potential discrepancies in reported profits</strong> and highlighted the company&#x27;s reliance on <strong>political influence</strong> to secure favorable outcomes.  His articles challenged the narrative of Reliance&#x27;s success as solely a result of business acumen, suggesting that manipulation and questionable practices played a significant role.</p>
<p>The <strong>Indian Express</strong> faced legal challenges from Reliance in an attempt to suppress Gurumurthy&#x27;s reporting.  Reliance sought to silence the newspaper through <strong>court injunctions</strong>, claiming that the articles contained false information and damaged the company&#x27;s reputation.</p>
<h1>Chapter 21</h1>
<p>Despite Reliance&#x27;s attempts to silence the Indian Express, the newspaper continued its investigation, publishing further allegations of <strong>financial irregularities</strong> and <strong>manipulation of share prices</strong>. The newspaper&#x27;s relentless reporting contributed to a decline in Reliance&#x27;s share price.</p>
<p>Reliance faced multiple legal challenges, including a lawsuit alleging that the company had <strong>defrauded debenture holders</strong> by issuing a new series of convertible debentures without properly considering their rights.</p>
<h1>Chapter 22</h1>
<p>Amidst the ongoing controversy and legal battles, Reliance successfully launched a <strong>new series of convertible debentures (G Series)</strong>, raising significant capital.  The company&#x27;s ability to attract investment despite negative publicity showcased Ambani&#x27;s <strong>influence and persuasive power</strong>.</p>
<p>Reliance utilized aggressive tactics to <strong>counter negative market sentiment</strong>, including pressuring brokers to cover their short positions, which led to losses for those betting against the company&#x27;s share price.</p>
<h1>Chapter 23</h1>
<p>The <strong>Fairfax affair</strong> involved the hiring of a US-based private investigative firm, Fairfax Group, to investigate Reliance&#x27;s overseas financial dealings.  The circumstances surrounding Fairfax&#x27;s engagement and the subsequent controversy highlighted the <strong>political intrigue</strong> surrounding Reliance and its alleged connections to powerful figures.</p>
<p>The investigation into Fairfax led to the <strong>transfer of V. P. Singh</strong> from the Finance Ministry and the <strong>removal of Bhure Lal</strong>, the Enforcement Director who had hired Fairfax, from his position.</p>
<h1>Chapter 24</h1>
<p>The Fairfax affair took a dramatic turn with the emergence of <strong>forged letters</strong> implicating Reliance&#x27;s rivals, including Nusli Wadia, in a conspiracy to undermine the government. The letters alleged that Wadia had secretly funded Fairfax and sought to use the investigation for his own benefit.</p>
<p>The forged letters led to a <strong>criminal investigation</strong>, targeting those perceived as enemies of the government.  The <strong>CBI</strong> was used to harass and intimidate individuals who had challenged Reliance.</p>
<h1>Chapter 25</h1>
<p>The <strong>publication of the forged Fairfax letters</strong> in the Indian Express exposed the attempts to frame Reliance&#x27;s opponents. The letters were revealed to be <strong>fabrications</strong>, discrediting the government&#x27;s narrative and highlighting the extent to which it was willing to go to protect its allies.</p>
<p>The <strong>Thakkar-Natarajan inquiry</strong> investigated the Fairfax affair, uncovering the involvement of government officials in the conspiracy to target Reliance&#x27;s rivals. The inquiry revealed the <strong>abuse of power</strong> and the misuse of law enforcement agencies for political purposes.</p>
<h1>Chapter 26</h1>
<p>The aftermath of the Fairfax affair saw the <strong>rehabilitation of Nusli Wadia</strong> and the discrediting of those who had sought to frame him. The episode exposed the <strong>deep divisions and political machinations</strong> within the Indian government and the lengths to which powerful individuals would go to protect their interests.</p>
<p>Reliance continued its aggressive expansion, acquiring control of <strong>Larsen &amp; Toubro</strong>, a major engineering and construction company. The takeover was facilitated by Reliance&#x27;s allies in financial institutions, further highlighting the company&#x27;s influence and its ability to leverage its connections for strategic gain.</p>
<h1>Chapter 27</h1>
<p>Ambani&#x27;s ambition extended to the <strong>media industry</strong>, with plans to establish a <strong>business newspaper</strong>.  This move was seen as a way for Reliance to control its own narrative and counter the negative coverage it had received from other publications.</p>
<h1>Chapter 28</h1>
<p>Ambani&#x27;s dominance in the polyester industry continued, with Reliance securing <strong>favorable government policies</strong> and <strong>exploiting loopholes</strong> to gain an advantage over its rivals.   Reliance&#x27;s influence over government decision-making processes raised concerns about <strong>fair competition</strong> and the potential for <strong>monopoly power</strong>.</p>
<p>Nusli Wadia continued to challenge Reliance&#x27;s practices, highlighting the company&#x27;s <strong>unethical tactics</strong> and its manipulation of the system.  However, Wadia&#x27;s efforts to secure a level playing field were often met with resistance from Reliance&#x27;s powerful allies in the government.</p>
<h1>Chapter 29</h1>
<p>The alleged <strong>conspiracy to murder Nusli Wadia</strong> involved a Reliance executive, Kirti Ambani, hiring individuals from the criminal underworld to carry out the attack. The investigation into this plot exposed the <strong>dark side of Reliance&#x27;s business practices</strong> and the lengths to which the company was willing to go to silence its critics.</p>
<h1>Chapter 30</h1>
<p>The investigation into the alleged murder plot against Wadia faced <strong>interference and obstruction</strong> from law enforcement agencies.  Evidence emerged suggesting that <strong>senior officials</strong> within the CBI were protecting Reliance and hindering the investigation.</p>
<h1>Chapter 31</h1>
<p>The investigation into the alleged murder plot against Wadia revealed the <strong>close ties between Reliance and influential figures</strong> in the government and law enforcement agencies. Reliance&#x27;s ability to <strong>manipulate the system</strong> and evade accountability raised serious concerns about the rule of law and the integrity of institutions.</p>
<h1>Chapter 32</h1>
<p>Reliance faced a series of <strong>scandals and investigations</strong> related to <strong>customs duty evasion</strong> and <strong>tax avoidance</strong>.  The company&#x27;s complex financial dealings and aggressive tax planning strategies attracted scrutiny from authorities.</p>
<h1>Chapter 33</h1>
<p>The implementation of the <strong>Mandal Commission report</strong>, which recommended affirmative action for lower castes, triggered <strong>social unrest</strong> and highlighted the deep-seated <strong>caste divisions</strong> within Indian society. This policy had a significant impact on the political landscape and contributed to the rise of identity politics.</p>
<h1>Chapter 34</h1>
<p>Nusli Wadia and Rajiv Gandhi, who had once been close friends, <strong>reconciled</strong> after the events of the Fairfax affair.  Their reconciliation symbolized the shifting political alliances and the complexities of personal relationships amidst the backdrop of intense business rivalries.</p>
<h1>Chapter 35</h1>
<p>Reliance continued to pursue <strong>aggressive financial strategies</strong>, including <strong>issuing a large number of shares</strong>, which diluted the holdings of existing investors.  The company&#x27;s actions raised concerns about transparency and corporate governance.</p>
<h1>Chapter 36</h1>
<p>Dhirubhai Ambani&#x27;s <strong>succession plan</strong> involved handing over control of Reliance to his two sons, Mukesh and Anil. The division of responsibilities and the potential for future conflicts within the family business remained uncertain.</p>
<h1>Chapter 37</h1>
<p>Reliance&#x27;s relationship with the <strong>Bombay Stock Exchange</strong> deteriorated, leading to the company <strong>delisting its shares</strong> from the exchange. The move highlighted Reliance&#x27;s <strong>growing power</strong> and its willingness to challenge established institutions.</p>
<h1>Chapter 38</h1>
<p>The <strong>Harshad Mehta scam</strong>, a major stock market manipulation scheme, implicated several brokers and banks. Although Reliance&#x27;s involvement in the scam was never conclusively proven, <strong>suspicions</strong> lingered about the company&#x27;s potential role in the financial irregularities.</p>
<h1>Chapter 39</h1>
<p>Reliance faced <strong>accusations of market manipulation</strong> and <strong>insider trading</strong> from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The company was accused of using a network of brokers and front companies to influence share prices and benefit from insider information.</p>
<h1>Chapter 40</h1>
<p>Reliance&#x27;s <strong>aggressive response</strong> to accusations of market manipulation led to a <strong>suspension of trading in its shares</strong> by the Bombay Stock Exchange.  The company&#x27;s defiant stance and its willingness to confront regulatory authorities highlighted its <strong>uncompromising nature</strong> and its belief in its own power.</p>
<h1>Chapter 41</h1>
<p>Investigations into Reliance&#x27;s financial dealings revealed a <strong>complex web of transactions</strong> involving multiple front companies.  The investigations exposed the company&#x27;s use of these entities to <strong>obscure the true nature of its operations</strong> and potentially evade taxes and regulations.</p>
<h1>Chapter 42</h1>
<p>The author concludes that Dhirubhai Ambani&#x27;s story reflects <strong>both the positive and negative aspects of India&#x27;s economic transformation</strong>.  Ambani&#x27;s <strong>entrepreneurial spirit</strong>, his <strong>ability to adapt and innovate</strong>, and his <strong>grasp of complex financial strategies</strong> represented the dynamism of India&#x27;s emerging economy.</p>
<h1>Chapter 43</h1>
<p>The author reflects on the <strong>cultural factors</strong> that contributed to both Ambani&#x27;s success and the controversies surrounding his business practices.  He suggests that India&#x27;s <strong>pluralistic society</strong> and its <strong>vigorous democratic institutions</strong> serve as checks and balances against the excesses of unbridled capitalism.</p>
<h1>Chapter 44</h1>
<p>The author compares the <strong>moral dilemmas</strong> in Dhirubhai Ambani&#x27;s story to those depicted in the <strong>Mahabharata</strong>, the Indian epic. Ambani&#x27;s relentless pursuit of success, his willingness to bend rules, and the conflicts he engendered mirror the epic&#x27;s themes of <strong>ambition, duty, and the complexities of ethical decision-making</strong> in a world of power and competition.</p></article></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"content":"# Excerpts - The Polyester Prince\n*October 17, 2024*\n# Chapter 1\n\n**Dhirubhai Ambani was born to be a trader.** His family belongs to the Bania caste, a group within the traditional Hindu social order associated with merchants and bankers.
