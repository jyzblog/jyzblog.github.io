<p><em>November 6, 2024</em></p>
<p>My First Million podcast did an episode with Craig Clemens.</p>
<p><strong>Craig Clemens</strong>: he’s a world-class marketer and copywriter and has sold over a billion dollars of products online.</p>
<p>In this podcast episode, he goes over the 7 human hijacks you can use in your own marketing.</p>
<h2>Help your audience rebel:</h2>
<p>One of the first people they talk about is a guy called Edward Bernays.</p>
<p>If you didn’t know, Edward is Sigmund Freud&#x27;s nephew (weird connection…) and was known as the Father of Public Relations.</p>
<p>And one business he helped was a cigarette company called <strong>‘Lucky Strike’.</strong><br/>
<!-- -->They came to him and wanted more customers, but the difficult part of this was they basically had all the customers they could have which were men.</p>
<p>So, the problem they ran into was, who do they target next?</p>
<p>Back then, it was illegal for women to smoke, so they’d be off the table to market to… Right?</p>
<p>Not for Bernays.</p>
<p>Luckily at the time, there was a women&#x27;s rights movement and he used this to his advantage…</p>
<p>So Bernays organized a float and gathered all of the famous people of that day to go on a float down the Easter Parade where all the journalists and reporters would be…</p>
<p>Allowing there to be as many eyeballs on what he was about to pull off.</p>
<p>During this parade, all these ‘famous people’ of the time would pull out a cigarette and begin smoking it and declare that these cigarettes were “Torches of Freedom &#x27;&#x27;.<br/>
<!-- -->Using these ‘cigarettes’ to PROVE that they were equal to men.</p>
<p>![](https://preview.redd.it/craig-clemens-on-mfm-talking-about-7-human-hijacks-and-how-v0-0q5288ttrxxb1.jpg?width=1018&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf3a1d7b160c7eef21d7d1634a4e943aec16f851&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>As a result, this would boost the sales of cigarettes while targeting the women demographic.</p>
<p>But this is a perfect example of helping your audience rebel against the social norm and fan their flames -</p>
<p><em><strong>“You’re not like everyone else, you’re special… You were meant to be different”...</strong></em></p>
<p>These kinds of statements feel personal to the reader but chances are, they also appeal to the masses (Think of fortune cookies).</p>
<p>This is known as the Barnum effect.</p>
<p>A powerful tool to use in your copy and marketing.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sidenote: a lot of these stories are documented in Edward Bernay&#x27;s book called Propaganda -</strong></em></p>
<p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/craig-clemens-on-mfm-talking-about-7-human-hijacks-and-how-v0-bv6db4a3sxxb1.jpg?width=629&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c783c3e840beba7e3bf03311e6d9316309fac48" alt=""/></p>
<h2>The illusion of choice:</h2>
<p>In the 1920’s, only 5% of people brushed their teeth.<br/>
<!-- -->So, when the company Pepsodent came to Claude Hopkins and wanted to shift more of their products, there was a clear problem…</p>
<p>…There weren&#x27;t enough people brushing their teeth.</p>
<p>So, what did Claude Hopkins do?</p>
<p>He created a masterful ad campaign that has you do a demonstration with your teeth (check the ad below).</p>
<p>And how using this product will give you that ‘Movie Star Smile!’</p>
<p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/craig-clemens-on-mfm-talking-about-7-human-hijacks-and-how-v0-auxonbacsxxb1.jpg?width=736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25ce5fc7381a19daf97852a398ce8c371fc2b392" alt=""/></p>
<p>But one of the most important factors of this ad is that it catered to the benefits that the CUSTOMER would experience.</p>
<p>It didn’t focus on the features as much, but promised the reader that “Movie Star Smile”.</p>
<p>As a result, this ad campaign ran for 50 years and 85% of Americans brushed their teeth on a daily basis within the decade.<br/>
<!-- -->Making Pepsodent one of the leading toothpaste companies for decades to come.</p>
<p>So, what can we take away from this?</p>
<p>When you’re creating your marketing copy and ads, focus on the customer and how THEY will benefit.</p>
<h2>Making the population eat bacon for breakfast:</h2>
<p>Did you eat bacon for breakfast this morning?</p>
<p>Well if you did, you can thank Edward Bernays for that one as well.</p>
<p>Not only did he get women to smoke regularly, but he also got people to eat bacon in the mornings…</p>
<p><em><strong>How did he do this?</strong></em></p>
<p>Well when Beech-Nut Bacon came to Bernays and wanted to sell more products, this is what he did:</p>
<p>He asked thousands of doctors “Do you think a hearty breakfast containing bacon is the best way to start the day?”</p>
<p>And when a number of doctors came back and agreed with him, they published these findings in all of the newspapers.</p>
<p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/craig-clemens-on-mfm-talking-about-7-human-hijacks-and-how-v0-dejsjh6nsxxb1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ca82d5190079025f1aeaa43728f7a878fb1f670" alt=""/></p>
<p>As a result, this skyrocketed the sales of bacon as so many people were eating bacon for breakfast.</p>
<p>But what can we learn from this?</p>
<p>Well, the power of authority over dictating sales…</p>
<p><em><strong>…If thousands of doctors said it’s healthy, then it can’t be wrong, right?</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>And we see this today when doctors are starring in VSLs for health products, or influencers being used to push specific products.</strong></em></p>
<h2>Creating a category:</h2>
<p>If you didn’t know, Craig Clemens</p>
<p>But after he did some investigating, Craig realized some super shady stuff was going on in the food industry…</p>
<p>.. Companies claiming zero fat or zero sugar but they’re then pumped with substances that are just as bad, or even worse in some cases.</p>
<p>It was shown that companies were testing out these artificial sweeteners on animals and they’d find these test animals would grow tumors.</p>
<p>And that’s not even the worst part.</p>
<p>These companies would cut out the tumors, sew the animals back up, and say that nothing bad was happening… Crazy.</p>
<p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/craig-clemens-on-mfm-talking-about-7-human-hijacks-and-how-v0-c5s8d457txxb1.jpg?width=569&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d22692078d4ae272602b3a195a99aa5fe0487296" alt=""/></p>
<p>This is when Craig Clemens introduced the Probiotics brand under Golden Hippo.</p>
<p>And he went on to create one of, if not the biggest Probiotics brand out there.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Because of the education component that was drawing people in.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the VSLs was so effective, that Joe Rogan tweeted about it, not realizing it was an ad… Lol.</p>
<p><img src="https://preview.redd.it/craig-clemens-on-mfm-talking-about-7-human-hijacks-and-how-v0-gifpv2zgtxxb1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=733b2d3151b9bed518b59c3b5488a00e6115cf7f" alt=""/></p>
<p>But this all points back to that educational angle which has proven time and time again to be super effective.</p>
<p>And as a result, he was able to create his own category of Probiotics.</p>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>Now, I just covered everything that I found interesting, there are a few more topics they cover, if you want to check them all out, you can listen to the full podcast.</p>
