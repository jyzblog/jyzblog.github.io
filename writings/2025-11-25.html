<p><em>November 24, 2025</em></p>
<h3>I. The Vision and Playbook of Scale</h3>
<p>The success of The Coca-Cola Company, a $300 billion entity, is based on a simple formula of syrup, sugar, and water. The company&#x27;s story, spanning 140 years, is deeply intertwined with American history, influencing consumption patterns, attitudes toward leisure, work, advertising, and patriotism.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Munger&#x27;s Thought Experiment</strong> outlines the ideal strategy for building a valuable, non-alcoholic beverage company from scratch in the 1880s. The necessary components of this playbook, which Coca-Cola closely followed, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building a <strong>strong, protected, global brand</strong> and trademark with a universal taste.</li>
<li>Optimizing the product for <strong>refreshment</strong>, filling it with calories for energy, and including brain stimulants like <strong>caffeine and sugar</strong>. The original product also included now-illegal drugs.</li>
<li>Making the product <strong>available everywhere</strong> at a <strong>very low price</strong> to discourage competitors.</li>
<li>Associating the beverage through massive global advertising with <strong>&quot;the good life,&quot;</strong> happiness, family, sports heroes, and Christmas, creating a <strong>Pavlovian association</strong>.</li>
<li>Maintaining <strong>brand control</strong> while utilizing others&#x27; capital and employees for bottling and distribution.</li>
<li>Never changing the formula or flavor, though the sources suggest Coca-Cola did change its formula, which is why it is not a $2 trillion company today.</li>
</ul>
<h3>II. The Patent Medicine Roots and Early Formulation</h3>
<p>Coca-Cola&#x27;s origins lie in the post-Civil War era market for <strong>patent medicines</strong>. This industry was the &quot;seed crystal&quot; that created the modern American consumer business and the advertising industry by spending the first real scale dollars in newspapers. Patent medicines were cheap, easy to produce, and easy to transport, starting as commodities like leaves, nuts, and water.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Founder:</strong> Coca-Cola was started by <strong>Dr. John Pemberton</strong>, a Confederate war veteran addicted to morphine (&quot;army disease&quot;) following injuries in the war.</li>
<li><strong>The Ingredients:</strong> In the mid-1880s, Pemberton, seeking a cure, learned about <strong>cocaine</strong>, which was widely encouraged and legal at the time. He copied and improved upon a popular French cocaine-fortified wine called Vin Mariani (endorsed by figures like Thomas Edison and three Popes) by adding <strong>caffeine</strong> derived from African <strong>cola nuts</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The Original Product:</strong> Pemberton&#x27;s French Wine Coca contained both coca leaves (for cocaine) and cola nuts (for caffeine).</li>
<li><strong>The Soft Drink Transition:</strong> When Prohibition hit Atlanta in the fall of 1885, Pemberton scrambled to create a non-alcoholic &quot;soft drink&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>The Formula (1886):</strong> Pemberton, aiming for a five-cent, anytime refreshment rather than a medicine, used <strong>synthetic caffeine</strong> (purchased from Merc) because the cola nut tasted bitter. The formula included vast amounts of sugar to offset the bitterness of the cola and cocoa plants, caramel for color, lime juice, citric acid, phosphoric acid, and flavorings like vanilla extract, orange elixir, lemon, nutmeg, coriander, and oil of cassia (Chinese cinnamon).</li>
<li><strong>Cocaine Content:</strong> The inaugural batch contained cocaine. Roughly four or five glasses of this early Coca-Cola would equate to a line of cocaine today. This cocaine component was phased out within the first few years.</li>
<li><strong>The Name and Logo:</strong> Pemberton&#x27;s business partner, <strong>Frank Robinson</strong>, created the &quot;simple descriptive perfect name,&quot; <strong>Coca-Cola</strong>, and designed the unchanging <strong>Spencerian script logo</strong> in 1887.</li>
</ul>
<h3>III. Growth, Couponing, and the Bottling System</h3>
<p>Early sales were successful, partly because the drink combined the medicinal benefits of caffeine and cocaine with an enjoyable taste.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coupon Strategy:</strong> Lacking capital for traditional ads, Pemberton and Robinson implemented the <strong>first manufacturer&#x27;s coupon</strong> redeemable at a retailer. They mailed tickets for free glasses of Coke to every address in the Atlanta city directory, a strategy that incentivized consumers, drugstores (by increasing foot traffic), and traveling salesmen.</li>
<li><strong>Profitability:</strong> The syrup was sold to soda fountains for about $1.30 per gallon, yielding 128 drinks, which were sold for 5 cents each, resulting in $6.40 in revenue and sweet retail margins for the drugstores. In 1892, the first official year of the definitive Coca-Cola Company (founded by <strong>Asa Candler</strong>), the company made $12,000 in profit with only three employees, making roughly 8x the average household income.</li>
<li><strong>Advertising and Presence:</strong> Candler and Robinson invested heavily in outdoor and point-of-sale signage, including oil cloth signs, painted murals (20,000 by 1894), posters, calendars, serving trays, and clocks. They provided these materials for free to drugstores, which made the stores look like Coca-Cola franchises.</li>
<li><strong>Evolving Slogans:</strong> Initially marketed as a <strong>&quot;brain tonic and sovereign remedy for headache and nervousness&quot;</strong>, Robinson realized they were &quot;advertising to the few... when we ought to advertise to the masses&quot;. Slogans shifted toward <strong>&quot;Delicious and Refreshing,&quot;</strong> emphasizing the product&#x27;s positive social benefits.</li>
<li><strong>The $1 Contract:</strong> In 1899, Candler made what was &quot;maybe simultaneously the best and the worst business deal in history&quot; by giving two entrepreneurs, Benjamin Thomas and Joseph Whitehead, the right to <strong>bottle and sell Coca-Cola for free</strong>. The contract included a volume discount price of <strong>$1 per gallon of syrup</strong> in perpetuity. This deal allowed Coca-Cola to enter the bottle business <strong>completely capital and investment free</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The Bottler System:</strong> Thomas and Whitehead split their territory and subcontracted the rights, leading to the rapid proliferation of local bottling operations across America. This established the <strong>&quot;Coca-Cola system,&quot;</strong> granting the parent company ridiculous leverage and high margins by focusing on syrup manufacturing and marketing, while using the bottlers&#x27; capital for distribution. By 1895, Coke was sold in every U.S. state and territory.</li>
</ul>
<h3>IV. Trademark Defense and Product Standardization</h3>
<p>Coca-Cola aggressively defended its intellectual property and brand identity:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trademark War:</strong> Following the 1905 Federal Trademark Act, Coca-Cola sued and shut down <strong>over 7,000 copycat cola brands</strong>. The Supreme Court ruled in 1920 that &quot;Coca-Cola means a single thing coming from a single source,&quot; transcending its descriptive name and protecting it as a unique brand.</li>
<li><strong>Decocainization:</strong> By <strong>1905</strong>, nearly all cocaine had been removed from the formula. The company contracted with Schaefer Alkaloid Works (which still exists today) to import coca leaves, decocainize them under federal supervision, and use the leaves for flavor. This process helped <strong>protect the formula</strong> because no other commercial entity had access to the leaves.</li>
<li><strong>The Contour Bottle:</strong> To combat imitators, the company forced bottlers in 1916 to invest in a <strong>proprietary, distinctive bottle</strong>. The winning design, the <strong>Contour bottle</strong> (or &quot;May West bottle&quot;), was so distinct that it could be recognized by feel in the dark or broken on the ground. A 1949 study showed <strong>less than 1% of Americans</strong> could not identify the bottle by shape alone, leading to its rare grant of <strong>trademark status for packaging</strong> in 1951.</li>
<li><strong>Caffeine Reduction:</strong> Coca-Cola appeased federal regulators by cutting the caffeine content by two-thirds.</li>
</ul>
<h3>V. Robert Woodruff and the Invention of Lifestyle Advertising</h3>
<p>In 1923, <strong>Robert Woodruff</strong> (age 33) took over as company president, becoming the youngest president of any major U.S. corporation at the time. He would control the company until his death in 1985.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lifestyle Marketing:</strong> Woodruff and adman Archie Lee eliminated descriptive ad copy and embraced <strong>&quot;extrinsic advertising,&quot;</strong> associating the product with feelings, happiness, and the ideal American lifestyle. Slogans included &quot;Coca-Cola always delightful&quot; (1923), &quot;Refresh Yourself&quot; (1924), and the grand slam <strong>&quot;The Pause That Refreshes&quot;</strong> (1929), which resonated deeply during the Depression as a simple, affordable luxury.</li>
<li><strong>Idyllic Imagery:</strong> Coca-Cola commissioned famous American artists like <strong>Norman Rockwell</strong> to create idyllic American lifestyle scenes for advertisements, promoting wholesomeness.</li>
<li><strong>Santa Claus:</strong> In 1931, the company commissioned artist Haden Sun Bloom to create Christmas ads featuring Santa, which standardized the modern, jolly, <strong>red-suited Santa Claus</strong> (the &quot;Coca-Cola Santa&quot;) and cemented the beverage&#x27;s association with Christmas.</li>
<li><strong>Standardization:</strong> Woodruff championed standardization of the formula, marketing, and packaging globally. He moved the secret formula from a New York vault (where it was collateral for a loan) to Atlanta. It was kept as a <strong>trade secret</strong> rather than patented, protecting it indefinitely.</li>
<li><strong>International Expansion:</strong> Woodruff used the bottling franchise model to expand into Europe and South America.</li>
</ul>
<h3>VI. The Pepsi Challenge and New Coke</h3>
<p>The only legitimate competitor to survive was <strong>Pepsi</strong>, which tried to sell itself to Coca-Cola three separate times.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pepsi&#x27;s Advantage:</strong> Because Coca-Cola was locked into its 6.5-ounce proprietary contour bottle, Pepsi found its counterpositioning strategy in 1934: selling <strong>12-ounce recycled beer bottles</strong> of Pepsi for the same <strong>nickel price</strong>. Since liquid cost was negligible compared to the bottle and sugar, Pepsi offered <strong>twice the volume</strong> for the same price, becoming a compelling consumer value proposition during the Depression.</li>
<li><strong>Pepsi&#x27;s Turnaround:</strong> A former Coke executive, <strong>Alfred Steel</strong>, joined Pepsi in the late 1940s. He radicalized Pepsi&#x27;s marketing by:<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>Targeting <strong>Black Americans</strong> with dedicated sales teams and advertising.</li>
<li>Positioning Pepsi as the <strong>&quot;lighter drink&quot;</strong>.</li>
<li>Wholeheartedly embracing <strong>television</strong> to target the youth (the &quot;Pepsi Generation&quot;).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Coke&#x27;s Market Research:</strong> By the late 1950s, blind taste tests run by Coke&#x27;s new ad agency, Macan Ericson, revealed that consumers <strong>preferred the taste of Pepsi</strong>. Robert Woodruff suppressed this data, instructing the agency never to run the test again.</li>
<li><strong>The Pepsi Challenge:</strong> In the mid-1970s, Pepsi&#x27;s new VP of marketing, <strong>John Sculley</strong> (later CEO of Apple), scaled a grassroots campaign: the <strong>Pepsi Challenge</strong>. Local bottlers used <strong>home video camcorders</strong> to film real people in supermarkets and malls choosing Pepsi over Coke in blind taste tests, airing the spots on local TV. This was hugely successful, and by 1977, Pepsi surpassed Coke in the bottled market.</li>
<li><strong>New Coke (1985):</strong> After years of declining market share, CEO Roberto Goizueta decided to replace the 99-year-old original formula. Taste tests confirmed people preferred the taste of the <strong>New Coke</strong> formula over both Pepsi and original Coke. However, the company <strong>never asked consumers how they would feel if the original formula was replaced</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The Disaster:</strong> New Coke was released on April 23, 1985, following a massive public relations disaster fueled by Pepsi&#x27;s full-page newspaper ad: <strong>&quot;The other guy just blinked&quot;</strong>. The company received thousands of angry calls and letters, realizing they had taken away &quot;people&#x27;s childhood&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>The Resurrection:</strong> After only <strong>79 days</strong>, on July 10, 1985, the company announced the return of the original beverage as <strong>Coca-Cola Classic</strong>. Within a year, Coca-Cola Classic <strong>surged past</strong> the market share heights it had held before the debacle, providing an <strong>accidental publicity stunt</strong> that re-engaged consumers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>VII. World War II and International Scale</h3>
<p>World War II was the <strong>&quot;greatest sampling program in the history of the world&quot;</strong> for Coca-Cola.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wartime Exemption:</strong> Coca-Cola successfully lobbied the U.S. government, arguing that Coke was an essential <strong>&quot;morale-building product&quot;</strong> for troops. They were granted an exemption from sugar rationing to supply the military.</li>
<li><strong>Global Infrastructure:</strong> The military granted Coca-Cola employees &quot;technical observer status,&quot; allowing them to participate in the military&#x27;s global supply and infrastructure buildout. From 1941 to 1945, 64 portable bottling plants were sent to Asia, Europe, and North Africa, distributing <strong>more than 5 billion bottles</strong> to troops.</li>
<li><strong>Accelerated Rollout:</strong> The war effort opened up international markets that would have otherwise taken <strong>25 years</strong> and millions of dollars to achieve. By 1950, one-third of Coke&#x27;s profits came from abroad.</li>
<li><strong>Fanta:</strong> The soft drink <strong>Fanta</strong> (which Coke now owns) was created by German Coca-Cola bottling entrepreneurs who lost access to the real ingredients during World War II and made a knock-off drink instead.</li>
</ul>
<h3>VIII. The Business Today and Core Dynamics</h3>
<p>Coca-Cola&#x27;s model today is defined by high margins and massive scale.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Beverage Company:</strong> The company has shifted to become a &quot;total beverage company&quot; in response to global health trends like the rise of obesity and market movements away from colas. However, this diversification has been challenging, marked by significant missed opportunities, such as turning down the chance to acquire Frito-Lay and the board rejecting a $16 billion deal to acquire Quaker Oats and Gatorade (which Pepsi acquired instead).</li>
<li><strong>Revenue and Employees:</strong> Coca-Cola&#x27;s internal company revenue is $47 billion, but the overall system revenue (including bottlers) is $175 billion. Only <strong>10% of the total system employees</strong> work for the Coca-Cola company itself (70,000 internal vs. 700,000 system-wide), but they capture <strong>27% of the system revenue</strong>, demonstrating immense leverage.</li>
<li><strong>Product Mix:</strong> Despite diversification, <strong>69% of revenue</strong> still comes from sparkling soft drinks. <strong>40% of all volume</strong> is from the trademark Coca-Cola family (Coke, Diet Coke, Coke Zero, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Growth and Valuation:</strong> Coca-Cola has a market cap of <strong>$300 billion</strong>. Growth has been slow since 1998, averaging only 3-4% annually.</li>
<li><strong>Core Powers:</strong> The business thrives primarily on <strong>Scale Economies</strong> (amortizing massive advertising spend and manufacturing/distribution costs) and <strong>Branding</strong> (built over a century of investment). The company does not rely on high switching costs or network effects.</li>
</ul>
<h3>IX. The Quintessence: System and Incentives</h3>
<p>The company is best viewed as a <strong>system, not a single company</strong>. Its success stems from figuring out how to <strong>incentivize partners</strong> (bottlers, retailers, soda fountain operators, and even billboard owners during the Depression) to profitably sell its product. Robert Woodruff&#x27;s mantra was that <strong>&quot;everyone who has anything to do with Coca-Cola should make money&quot;</strong>. The power is in repetition: a story of 150 years of <strong>&quot;always delicious always refreshing&quot;</strong>.</p></article></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"content":"# Notes - Acquired - Coca Cola\n*November 24, 2025*\n\n### I.

However, the company **never asked consumers how they would feel if the original formula was replaced**.\n*   **The Disaster:** New Coke was released on April 23, 1985, following a massive public relations disaster fueled by Pepsi's full-page newspaper ad: **\"The other guy just blinked\"**. The company received thousands of angry calls and letters, realizing they had taken away \"people's childhood\".\n*   **The Resurrection:** After only **79 days**, on July 10, 1985, the company announced the return of the original beverage as **Coca-Cola Classic**. Within a year, Coca-Cola Classic **surged past** the market share heights it had held before the debacle, providing an **accidental publicity stunt** that re-engaged consumers.\n\n### VII. World War II and International Scale\n\nWorld War II was the **\"greatest sampling program in the history of the world\"** for Coca-Cola.\n\n*   **Wartime Exemption:** Coca-Cola successfully lobbied the U.S. government, arguing that Coke was an essential **\"morale-building product\"** for troops. They were granted an exemption from sugar rationing to supply the military.\n*   **Global Infrastructure:** The military granted Coca-Cola employees \"technical observer status,\" allowing them to participate in the military's global supply and infrastructure buildout. From 1941 to 1945, 64 portable bottling plants were sent to Asia, Europe, and North Africa, distributing **more than 5 billion bottles** to troops.\n*   **Accelerated Rollout:** The war effort opened up international markets that would have otherwise taken **25 years** and millions of dollars to achieve. By 1950, one-third of Coke's profits came from abroad.\n*   **Fanta:** The soft drink **Fanta** (which Coke now owns) was created by German Coca-Cola bottling entrepreneurs who lost access to the real ingredients during World War II and made a knock-off drink instead.\n\n### VIII. The Business Today and Core Dynamics\n\nCoca-Cola's model today is defined by high margins and massive scale.\n\n*   **Total Beverage Company:** The company has shifted to become a \"total beverage company\" in response to global health trends like the rise of obesity and market movements away from colas. However, this diversification has been challenging, marked by significant missed opportunities, such as turning down the chance to acquire Frito-Lay and the board rejecting a \\$16 billion deal to acquire Quaker Oats and Gatorade (which Pepsi acquired instead).\n*   **Revenue and Employees:** Coca-Cola's internal company revenue is \\$47 billion, but the overall system revenue (including bottlers) is \\$175 billion. Only **10% of the total system employees** work for the Coca-Cola company itself (70,000 internal vs. 700,000 system-wide), but they capture **27% of the system revenue**, demonstrating immense leverage.\n*   **Product Mix:** Despite diversification, **69% of revenue** still comes from sparkling soft drinks. **40% of all volume** is from the trademark Coca-Cola family (Coke, Diet Coke, Coke Zero, etc.).\n*   **Growth and Valuation:** Coca-Cola has a market cap of **\\$300 billion**. Growth has been slow since 1998, averaging only 3-4% annually.\n*   **Core Powers:** The business thrives primarily on **Scale Economies** (amortizing massive advertising spend and manufacturing/distribution costs) and **Branding** (built over a century of investment). The company does not rely on high switching costs or network effects.\n\n### IX. The Quintessence: System and Incentives\n\nThe company is best viewed as a **system, not a single company**. Its success stems from figuring out how to **incentivize partners** (bottlers, retailers, soda fountain operators, and even billboard owners during the Depression) to profitably sell its product. Robert Woodruff's mantra was that **\"everyone who has anything to do with Coca-Cola should make money\"**. The power is in repetition: a story of 150 years of **\"always delicious always refreshing\"**.","headings":[{"level":3,"text":"I.
