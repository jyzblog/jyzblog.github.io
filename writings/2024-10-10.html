<p><em>October 9, 2024</em></p>
<h3>Chapter 1: Money Markets</h3>
<p><strong>Central bank money</strong> is true money. It can only exist in the form of physical cash or as money on account at the central bank. Money on account with a commercial bank is not final money but a promise to pay central bank money.</p>
<p><strong>Money markets</strong> exist because of the payment system. When customers make deposits, the bank needs to get a return on that money, so it lends to other customers or banks at an agreed interest rate and maturity. This interbank lending creates a money market, which is crucial for banks to manage their balances and avoid overdrafts at the central bank.</p>
<p><strong>Central banks control short-term interest rates</strong> through their money market operations. Commercial banks are obligated to borrow from the central bank to clear their overdrafts, which gives the central bank significant control over short-term rates.</p>
<p><strong>The London money market is active in major currencies</strong>, particularly dollars, sterling, euros, yen, and Swiss francs. The term &#x27;euro&#x27; can cause ambiguity because it can refer to the eurozone currency and currencies outside their home jurisdiction, such as eurodollars.</p>
<h3>Chapter 2: Government Bonds</h3>
<p><strong>A bond is a promise to pay a series of cash flows</strong> in the form of interest coupons and the principal at maturity. The price of a bond is inversely related to its yield.</p>
<p><strong>Repurchase agreements (repo)</strong> are used in the bond market to borrow bonds. A dealer who has sold a bond but doesn&#x27;t own it can borrow that bond using repo. The repo rate reflects the demand for a particular bond.</p>
<p><strong>Stripping</strong> allows some government bonds to be exchanged for their individual cash flows, creating zero-coupon bonds.</p>
<p><strong>Non-government bonds carry a risk of default</strong>, unlike government bonds issued in the currency over which the government is sovereign. Investors demand higher yields on non-government bonds to compensate for the credit risk. Credit rating agencies assess the creditworthiness of issuers.</p>
<h3>Chapter 3: Futures</h3>
<p><strong>Futures contracts mitigate counterparty credit risk</strong> through a clearing house. The clearing house guarantees the contract, ensuring that buyers and sellers are not exposed to each other&#x27;s default risk.</p>
<p>Futures contracts have <strong>standardized specifications</strong>, including the underlying asset, delivery date, and delivery mechanism. This standardization eliminates ambiguity and facilitates trading.</p>
<p><strong>Futures markets employ margin requirements</strong>. Initial margin is paid upfront to cover potential losses, and variation margin is paid or received daily to reflect changes in the contract&#x27;s value.</p>
<p><strong>Futures contracts can be physically delivered or cash settled</strong>. Physical delivery involves transferring the underlying asset, while cash settlement involves paying or receiving the difference between the contract price and the final settlement price.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitrage keeps spot and futures prices in line</strong>. If there is a significant difference between the spot and futures prices, arbitrageurs will exploit the discrepancy, bringing the prices back into equilibrium.</p>
<p><strong>Three-month interest-rate futures are traded against bonds</strong>. The difference between the price of the futures contract and the price of a comparable bond is known as the TED spread.</p>
<h3>Chapter 4: Swaps</h3>
<p><strong>Swaps exchange fixed-rate debt for floating-rate debt</strong>. They allow market participants to manage interest rate risk by converting between fixed and floating interest payments.</p>
<p><strong>The credit risk in swaps is lower than in loans</strong> because only the net interest payments are exchanged. However, there is still some credit exposure, which can be mitigated through collateralization, break clauses, recouponing, and clearing houses.</p>
<p><strong>Basis swaps exchange floating-rate payments in different currencies</strong>. They allow for the conversion of assets or liabilities between currencies.</p>
<h3>Chapter 5: Options</h3>
<p><strong>Options grant the holder the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset</strong>. Call options give the holder the right to buy, while put options give the holder the right to sell.</p>
<p><strong>The price of an option is influenced by several factors</strong>, including the current forward price, the volatility of the forward price, and prevailing interest rates.</p>
<p><strong>Implied volatility is the breakeven volatility</strong> of the price of the underlying asset that is implied by the option price.</p>
<p><strong>Options can be traded in combinations</strong> and can be embedded in other financial instruments.</p>
<p><strong>The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)</strong> is a widely followed measure of implied volatility in the US stock market.</p>
<h3>Chapter 6: Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p><strong>Foreign exchange markets facilitate international trade and investment</strong>. They enable businesses and investors to convert currencies, allowing for transactions across borders.</p>
<p><strong>Forward foreign exchange contracts allow market participants to lock in exchange rates</strong> for future dates.</p>
<p><strong>Exotic options can have a short-term impact on exchange rates</strong> due to their complex features and potential for manipulation.</p>
<p><strong>CLS reduces settlement risk in foreign exchange transactions</strong> by acting as a clearing house, netting payments, and staggering settlement in tranches.</p>
<h3>Chapter 7: Players</h3>
<p><strong>Governments issue bonds to borrow money</strong>, primarily in their domestic currency. They are typically not price-sensitive in their issuance and often use auctions to sell their debt.</p>
<p><strong>Pension funds</strong> are major long-term investors in fixed-income markets, seeking to match their long-term liabilities with investments that provide stable returns. They often track bond indices, influencing the demand for bonds included in those indices.</p>
<p><strong>Insurers invest in bonds to hedge their annuity obligations</strong> and manage the risks associated with their insurance policies.</p>
<p><strong>Mutual funds pool the savings of individuals</strong> to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets, including bonds.</p>
<p><strong>Hedge funds use leverage to take on higher levels of risk</strong> and seek to generate higher returns. They may engage in a wide range of trading strategies, including macro and relative value trades.</p>
<p><strong>Commercial banks issue debt to raise capital</strong>, and the structure of this debt is influenced by bank regulations, tax laws, and investor preferences.</p>
<p><strong>Central banks manage foreign exchange reserves</strong>, investing them in low-risk, short-dated assets, primarily in US dollars.</p>
<p><strong>Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)</strong> provide a low-cost and accessible way for individuals to invest in a basket of assets, including stocks and bonds.</p>
<h3>Chapter 8: People</h3>
<p><strong>Proprietary traders use their employer&#x27;s capital</strong> to make profits by speculating on market movements.</p>
<p><strong>Market makers provide liquidity to clients</strong> by quoting bid and offer prices, aiming to profit from the bid-offer spread.</p>
<p><strong>Salespeople connect clients with the bank&#x27;s trading and research capabilities</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers analyze markets and provide insights</strong> to traders, salespeople, and clients.</p>
<p><strong>Back and middle offices handle trade processing and settlement</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Investment bankers provide confidential advice to clients</strong> on mergers, acquisitions, and other financial matters.</p>
<h3>Chapter 9: Price Action</h3>
<p><strong>Price movements in financial markets are driven by the actions of buyers and sellers</strong>. The urgency and desperation of buyers or sellers can significantly influence price action.</p>
<p><strong>Leverage can amplify price movements</strong>. When leveraged participants are forced to close out losing positions, it can create a cascade effect, exacerbating price swings.</p>
<p><strong>Fixed-income markets are highly sensitive to central bank policy rates</strong>. Changes in interest rate expectations, inflation, and economic data can all impact bond prices.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-coupon curves are flatter than forward-rate curves</strong>, and par curves are even flatter.</p>
<h3>Chapter 10: Swaps Revisited</h3>
<p><strong>Swaps carry credit risk</strong>, but it can be reduced through techniques such as collateralization, break clauses, recouponing, and clearing houses.</p>
<p><strong>Basis swaps</strong> are used to convert between floating-rate payments in different currencies.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-currency basis swaps can have constant or variable notional amounts</strong>. Constant notional swaps maintain the same notional amount in both currencies, while variable notional swaps adjust the notional amount on the dollar leg to reflect changes in the exchange rate.</p>
<h3>Chapter 11: Non-government Issuance</h3>
<p><strong>Investment banks play a key role in assisting non-government entities in issuing debt</strong>. They provide advice, structure the issuance, and market the bonds to investors.</p>
<p><strong>The book-building process</strong> involves soliciting orders from investors before the bond is priced.</p>
<p><strong>The syndicate</strong>, led by the book-runner, manages the bond issuance process, allocates bonds to investors, and provides market-making support after the issuance.</p>
<p><strong>Corporate debt issuances are subject to legal and regulatory requirements</strong>, including selling restrictions, prospectus disclosures, and various clauses related to credit protection and force majeure events.</p>
<p><strong>Frequent issuers, such as supranational organizations</strong>, may use an abbreviated issuance process for opportunistic reopenings of existing bonds.</p>
<h3>Chapter 12: Yield, Duration, Repo, and Forward Bond Prices</h3>
<p><strong>Yields can be quoted with different compounding frequencies</strong>, and it is important to convert yields to a common basis for comparison.</p>
<p><strong>Duration and DV01 are measures of a bond&#x27;s price sensitivity to changes in yields</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Macaulay duration</strong> is the weighted average time to receive the cash flows from a bond, while modified duration measures the percentage price change for a given change in yield.</p>
<p><strong>Barbell trades</strong> involve buying or selling bonds at both ends of the maturity spectrum, often with a duration-neutral and cash-neutral weighting.</p>
<p><strong>Carry and slide</strong> are measures of the expected return from holding a bond, assuming different scenarios for yield changes.</p>
<h3>Chapter 13: Bond Futures</h3>
<p><strong>Bond futures contracts are more complex than futures on other assets</strong> due to the deliverable basket of bonds and the use of conversion factors.</p>
<p><strong>The short position in a bond futures contract will choose to deliver the cheapest-to-deliver (CTD) bond</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The CTD bond can change over time</strong> based on factors such as yield levels, the shape of the yield curve, and repo rates.</p>
<p><strong>Basis net of carry (BNOC)</strong> represents the value of the delivery option in a bond futures contract.</p>
<h3>Chapter 14: Basic Fixed-income Arithmetic</h3>
<p><strong>Market conventions</strong> in fixed-income trading are not always logical, but they are important to understand for accurate pricing and risk management.</p>
<p><strong>Calculating duration</strong> is crucial for bond traders to manage their interest rate risk exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Forward yield calculations</strong> can help traders assess the potential profitability of bond trades over a specific time horizon.</p></article></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"content":"# Excerpts - Pricing Money\n*October 9, 2024*\n### Chapter 1: Money Markets\n\n**Central bank money** is true money.
