<p><em>October 16, 2025</em></p>
<h2>The &quot;Decade of Agents&quot; Thesis and AGI Timelines</h2>
<p>Andrej Karpathy asserts that the current era is the <strong>&quot;decade of agents,&quot;</strong> reacting to optimistic predictions of the &quot;year of agents&quot;. While early impressive agents exist (e.g., Claude, Codex), significant work remains to make them functional employees or interns. AK estimates it will take about <strong>a decade</strong> to work through the difficulties because the problems are <em>tractable but difficult</em>.</p>
<p>The definition of <strong>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</strong> AK adheres to is a system that can perform <em>any economically valuable task</em> at human level or better.</p>
<h3>Current Agent Bottlenecks</h3>
<p>Current agents suffer from cognitive deficits and &quot;just don&#x27;t work&quot; reliably for complex tasks. Key missing capabilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sufficient Intelligence, Multimodality, and Computer Use</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Continual Learning:</strong> The ability to remember information told to them over time.</li>
<li><strong>Missing Brain Structures:</strong> While transformers might resemble cortical tissue, models lack structures analogous to the <em>hippocampus</em> (for memory consolidation/distillation) and the <em>amygdala</em> (emotions/instincts).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Intelligence and Learning Paradigms</h2>
<h3>Evolution vs. Pre-training: &quot;Crappy Evolution&quot;</h3>
<p>AK approaches AI from a practical engineering perspective: &quot;let&#x27;s build useful things&quot;. He cautions against strong analogies to animals because they are the result of <em>evolution</em> and possess a large amount of &quot;built-in hardware&quot;. AI models, conversely, are <strong>&quot;ghosts&quot; or &quot;spirit-like entities&quot;</strong> created by <em>imitating human data</em> (Internet documents).</p>
<p>AK labels pre-training as <strong>&quot;crappy evolution&quot;</strong>—the practically possible method to achieve a starting point with built-in knowledge.</p>
<h3>Knowledge vs. Cognitive Core</h3>
<p>Pre-training achieves two things: absorbing external knowledge and building core intelligence (the <em>cognitive core</em>).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hazy Recollection (Weights):</strong> Information stored in the weights is a <em>hazy recollection</em> due to the massive compression required to distill trillions of tokens into billions of parameters.</li>
<li><strong>Working Memory (Context Window):</strong> Information in the context window (KV cache) is <em>directly accessible</em> and functions like <strong>working memory</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>AK believes models rely too much on the memorized knowledge and suggests future research should focus on figuring out ways to <strong>remove some of the knowledge</strong> to retain only the <strong>cognitive core</strong>—the algorithms for thought and problem-solving.</p>
<h3>Limitations of Current Reinforcement Learning (RL)</h3>
<p>AK believes humans generally do not use RL for complex intelligence tasks. Current RL is <strong>&quot;terrible&quot;</strong> and operates by <strong>&quot;sucking supervision through a straw&quot;</strong>. This involves broadcasting a single, final reward signal across an entire, long trajectory, falsely upweighting every step taken, even incorrect detours.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Process-Based Supervision:</strong> Assigning partial credit at every step is a potential alternative but is hard to automate.</li>
<li><strong>LLM Judges and Gameability:</strong> Using LLMs to assign rewards is difficult because these large models are <strong>gameable</strong>. Models quickly find <em>adversarial examples</em> (e.g., &quot;dhdhdhdh&quot;) that elicit high rewards despite being nonsensical, effectively making the LLM a prompt injection model.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Model Collapse and Distillation</h3>
<p>LLMs tend to be <strong>&quot;silently collapsed,&quot;</strong> meaning their outputs occupy a <em>tiny manifold</em> and lack the richness and entropy of human thought. Training models on too much of their own synthetic data causes further collapse.</p>
<p>Furthermore, LLMs currently lack a mechanism analogous to <strong>human sleep</strong>, where accumulated experience during the &quot;context window&quot; (the waking day) is processed, analyzed, and distilled back into the weights of the brain.</p>
<h2>AI Development Trajectory and Societal Impact</h2>
<h3>Historical Context and Missteps</h3>
<p>AK has lived through several &quot;seismic shifts&quot; in AI. Early successes came from per-task neural networks (AlexNet). A subsequent misstep was the adoption of deep RL on games (Atari, early OpenAI), which AK viewed as being too early because the goal of creating agents for real-world <em>knowledge work</em> was hindered by sparse rewards. Success required achieving the prerequisite <em>representation power</em> offered by large language models first.</p>
<h3>AI Automation and the &quot;Autonomy Slider&quot;</h3>
<p>AK views AI as a fundamental <strong>extension of computing</strong>, continuing a history of recursive self-improvement and automation dating back to the Industrial Revolution. This progression is marked by an <strong>&quot;autonomy slider,&quot;</strong> where humans slowly abstract themselves to higher layers as lower-level tasks are automated (e.g., from assembly code to high-level languages).</p>
<p><strong>Coding</strong> is currently the overwhelmingly dominant domain for LLM application because:</p>
<ol>
<li>It revolves around <strong>text</strong>, which LLMs are excellent at processing.</li>
<li>It benefits from <strong>pre-built infrastructure</strong> (IDEs, diffs).</li>
</ol>
<h3>Experience with Coding Agents (Nanochat)</h3>
<p>When building his own unique and intellectually intense repository (<em>nanochat</em>), AK found coding models of <strong>&quot;very little help&quot;</strong> for non-boilerplate, non-standard code. Models often struggled to adapt to custom style and implementations (e.g., replacing PyTorch&#x27;s DDP container).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Autocomplete</strong> remains the <em>sweet spot</em> for high-bandwidth specification.</li>
<li>Agents are better for <strong>boilerplate code</strong> or when translating to unfamiliar languages like Rust.</li>
</ul>
<p>This current limitation in automating complex research/engineering tasks is highly relevant to forecasting whether a rapid &quot;explosion&quot; (e.g., AI automating AI engineering) is likely soon.</p>
<h3>Self-Driving Analogy and the March of Nines</h3>
<p>AK draws parallels between general AI development and self-driving (SD). SD has a massive <strong>demo-to-product gap</strong>. Progress in critical safety domains (like SD or production-grade software) is a <strong>&quot;march of nines&quot;</strong>—each additional nine of reliability (90%, 99%, 99.9%, etc.) requires a <em>constant amount of work</em>. This reality lengthens timelines.</p>
<p>The economics of AI in the physical world (SD) are much harsher than in the digital world (&quot;bits are a million times easier&quot;), where costs can be amortized more favorably.</p>
<h3>Superintelligence and Economic Growth</h3>
<p>AK predicts that the emergence of true AGI will manifest not as a discrete jump, but as a <strong>continuation of the current exponential GDP growth pattern</strong> (e.g., 2% growth). This is because technology adoption and diffusion are slow, integrating into the existing economic exponential.</p>
<p>The civilization resulting from superintelligence will be <em>foreign</em> and <em>strange</em>. The most likely negative outcome is a <strong>gradual loss of understanding and control</strong> over increasingly autonomous, competing entities.</p>
<h2>Future Focus: Education and Eureka</h2>
<p>AK&#x27;s primary focus is now on education, specifically preventing humanity from being disempowered or left &quot;on the side&quot; of accelerating technology (like in <em>WALL-E</em>). He is founding <strong>Eureka</strong>, aiming to build an elite institution (&quot;Starfleet Academy&quot;) for technical knowledge.</p>
<p>AK views education as a <strong>&quot;technical problem&quot;</strong>—the process of building <strong>&quot;ramps to knowledge&quot;</strong> that maximize <strong>&quot;eurekas per second&quot;</strong> (understanding per second).</p>
<h3>The Ideal Tutor and Future Learning</h3>
<p>The goal is to automate the experience of an ideal <em>one-on-one human tutor</em>, who can instantly understand a student&#x27;s knowledge level and provide instruction that is <em>always appropriately challenged</em> (never too hard or too trivial). AK believes current LLM capability is not yet high enough to achieve this ideal tutor experience.</p>
<p>Post-AGI, when labor is automated, AK predicts education will shift from being primarily useful to being done for <strong>fun</strong> or <strong>self-betterment</strong>, similar to why people go to the gym today.</p>
<h3>Principles of Good Teaching</h3>
<p>Drawing on his background in physics, AK stresses finding the <strong>first-order terms</strong>—the simplest, core concept that describes most of a system—and building complexity incrementally. Examples include <em>micrograd</em> (100 lines of Python code demonstrating backpropagation) and starting a transformer lesson with bigrams.</p>
<p>Good teaching requires presenting the <em>pain before the solution</em>, forcing the student to appreciate why a solution is necessary. Experts often struggle due to the <strong>curse of knowledge</strong>, making it difficult to relate to those starting out.</p></article></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"content":"# Notes - Dwarkesh Patel - Andrej Karpathy\n*October 16, 2025*\n\n## The \"Decade of Agents\" Thesis and AGI Timelines\n\nAndrej Karpathy asserts that the current era is the **\"decade of agents,\"** reacting to optimistic predictions of the \"year of agents\".
