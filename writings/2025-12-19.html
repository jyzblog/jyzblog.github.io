<p><em>colossus | December 18, 2025</em></p>
<p>Henry Ellenbogen, a renowned investor who transformed the T. Rowe Price New Horizons fund from $8 billion to $40 billion over nine years. His approach centers on identifying &quot;compounders&quot;—rare companies capable of sustained, long-term growth—and navigating the &quot;painful transitions&quot; where these companies either succeed or fail,.</p>
<h2>1. The Influence of Legacy and Early Career</h2>
<p>Ellenbogen’s background is rooted in a legacy of quiet service and high achievement.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Grandfather’s Secret:</strong> After his grandfather (the elder Henry Ellenbogen, a Congressman and Judge) died, the family discovered he had secretly saved <strong>thousands of lives</strong> from the Holocaust by typing sponsorship letters and navigating immigration law,,.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;The Boy Wonder&quot;:</strong> At age 19, Ellenbogen became the youngest administrative assistant (Chief of Staff) in the history of the <strong>U.S.  Representatives</strong> for Congressman Peter Deutsch.</li>
<li><strong>Formative Training:</strong> During a summer at <strong>Goldman Sachs’ risk arbitrage group</strong>, he realized he did not want to be an &quot;insurance adjuster&quot; calculating price corrections; instead, he wanted to support people building enduring businesses,.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. The Science of the &quot;Compounder&quot;</h2>
<p>Ellenbogen’s philosophy was refined through his study of market history and his tenure at T. Rowe Price.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Walmart Lesson:</strong> By studying 50 years of New Horizons archives, Ellenbogen discovered that <strong>only 20 stocks</strong> had driven the fund’s success. He realized that selling a company like <strong>Walmart</strong> prematurely was a catastrophic mistake that no other good decision could offset.</li>
<li><strong>The 1% Rule:</strong> Data revealed that in any 10-year period, only about <strong>40 out of 4,000 public stocks (1%)</strong> compound wealth at <strong>20% annually</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics of Compounders:</strong> These businesses show <strong>increasing returns on invested capital</strong>, meaning they get better and face lepetition as they gain scale. Examples include <strong>Vail Resorts</strong>, where acquisitions created a subscription-based network that shifted risk from the company to the customer.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. The &quot;Act 1 to Act 2&quot; Framework</h2>
<p>A central tenet of Ellenbogen’s method is separating companies that are <em>dying</em> from those being <em>remade</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Act 1:</strong> The stage where a company proves product-market fit and unit economics.</li>
<li><strong>Act 2:</strong> The &quot;leap&quot; to a new product or market that makes the business fundamentally larger.</li>
<li><strong>The Valley of Death:</strong> Transitions between acts are <strong>intensely volatile</strong>; a typical compounder might fall <strong>62%</strong> during its journey.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Example: Netflix:</strong></em> In 2011, Netflix&#x27;s transition from DVD-by-mail to streaming caused 800,000 cancellations and a <strong>75% stock drop</strong>,. Ellenbogen recognized it as a transition, not a failure, and led a <strong>$400 million private investment</strong> to save the company.</li>
<li><em><strong>Example: Amazon:</strong></em> Contrary to the myth that Jeff Bezos ignored profit, Ellenbogen observed that Bezos ran the retail business with <strong>obsessive operational discipline</strong>, establishing a cash stream <em>before</em> investing in new initiatives like AWS,.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Bridging Public and Private Markets</h2>
<p>Ellenbogen pioneered the practice of mutual funds investing in late-stage startups, arguing that companies were staying private longer and capturing more growth before their IPO,.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The &quot;Rogue Effort&quot;:</strong> Starting with companies like <strong>Twitter</strong> and <strong>Workday</strong>, Ellenbogen systematically deployed mutual fund capital into private rounds,.</li>
<li><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> His team covers both public and private companies because younger companies often reveal <strong>disruptive threats</strong> to existing winners (e.g., studying the disruption in web hosting led him to <strong>Wix and Shopify</strong>).</li>
<li><strong>The Network Effect:</strong> Ellenbogen uses a &quot;self-reinforcing&quot; network to help startups scale by placing experienced public-company CEOs (like <strong>Jeff Boyd of Priceline</strong>) onto the boards of private companies (like <strong>Clear</strong> and <strong>Redfin</strong>),.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. &quot;The Last Human Edge&quot;: Man vs. Machine</h2>
<p>In the age of algorithmic trading and AI (the &quot;robots&quot;), Ellenbogen argues that humans maintain a distinct advantage in specific areas.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trust and Empathy:</strong> Machines cannot build the trust required to call a CEO on a Saturday morning to discuss bankruptcy or structure a complex rescue deal.</li>
<li><strong>Interpreting Signals:</strong> Robots struggle to understand why a CEO selling shares at a loss might be a <strong>positive signal</strong> rather than a negative one.</li>
<li><strong>The Amygdala:</strong> Understanding the temperament of an entrepreneur who is solving a problem requires human judgment and an understanding of <strong>probabilities and people</strong>,,.</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. Durable Capital Partners and Modern Crisis Management</h2>
<p>In 2019, Ellenbogen founded <strong>Durable Capital Partners</strong> to pursue compounding without the structural limitations of mutual funds,.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investing in Chaos:</strong> During the COVID-19 crash, he invested <strong>$110 million in Redfin</strong> and <strong>$150 million in FirstService</strong>, providing capitalhen others were paralyzed by uncertainty,.</li>
<li><strong>Navigating the High-Interest Era:</strong> In 2022, as &quot;free money&quot; ended, Ellenbogen guided his portfolio companies, such as <strong>Duolingo</strong> and <strong>Affirm</strong>, to pivot from pure growth to <strong>extreme financial rigor and profitability</strong>,.</li>
<li><strong>The AI Platform Shift:</strong> Ellenbogen views <strong>AI</strong> as the fourth major platform shift of his career (following web, mobile, and cloud) and is currently identifying which emerging companies will dominate this new era.</li>
