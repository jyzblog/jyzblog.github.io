<p><em>November 22, 2025</em></p>
<h1>The Coca-Cola Story: Syrup, Scale, and System</h1>
<h2>I. Conceptual Foundations and Early Origins</h2>
<p>The Coca-Cola Company is a <strong>$300 billion company</strong> built primarily on syrup, sugar, and water. Its business success embodies Charlie Munger&#x27;s thought experiment on how to build a multi-trillion dollar company based on a non-alcoholic beverage. The strategy requires creating a <strong>strong, protected, global trademark</strong>, optimizing the taste for refreshing universal appeal, and ensuring ubiquitous availability at a <strong>very low price</strong>.</p>
<p>The product&#x27;s history is deeply intertwined with America, starting its roots in the <strong>post-Civil War</strong> era.</p>
<h3>The Patent Medicine Era (1880s)</h3>
<p>The modern American consumer business was seeded by the patent medicine industry, which capitalized on the chronic pain and <strong>morphine addiction (&quot;army disease&quot;)</strong> suffered by Civil War veterans.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dr. John Pemberton</strong>, a Confederate veteran seeking a cure for his own morphine addiction, developed his product during the height of popularity for <strong>cocaine</strong>.</li>
<li>Inspired by the successful cocaine-fortified French wine, <em>Vin Mariani</em>, Pemberton created <em>Pemberton&#x27;s French Wine Coca</em> by adding <strong>caffeine</strong> sourced from bitter cola nuts.</li>
<li>When <strong>Prohibition hit Atlanta in 1885</strong>, Pemberton scrambled to create a non-alcoholic &quot;soft drink&quot; version.</li>
<li>The ideal formula was designed as an affordable, high-margin, <strong>5-cent anytime refreshment</strong> available at drugstore soda fountains.</li>
<li>The earliest formula combined water, sugar, caramel coloring, acids, oils, vanilla, synthetic caffeine, and <strong>fluid extract of coca leaves</strong> (cocaine). Early concoctions were highly stimulating, containing up to four times the caffeine of modern Coke.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Early Branding and Growth</h3>
<p>Pemberton’s partner, <strong>Frank Robinson</strong>, named the product <strong>Coca-Cola</strong> and designed the famous <strong>Spencerian script logo</strong> in 1887, which remains virtually unchanged.</p>
<ul>
<li>Coke pioneered the use of the <strong>manufacturer&#x27;s coupon</strong> (the oldest known coupon in America) by mailing out tickets for free drinks. This highly profitable, high gross margin strategy incentivized consumers and increased foot traffic for soda fountain retailers.</li>
<li>In 1892, <strong>Asa Candler</strong> acquired the rights to the formula, incorporating the definitive Coca-Cola Company. In its first official year, the company made <strong>$12,000 in profit</strong> on $46,000 in revenue.</li>
<li>Early advertising was <em>intrinsic</em>, positioning Coke as an &quot;ideal brain tonic and sovereign remedy for headache and nervousness&quot;.</li>
<li>Candler and Robinson invested heavily in <em>outdoor and point-of-sale signage</em>, painting <strong>20,000 murals</strong> on buildings and barns by 1894 and providing drugstores with calendars, serving trays, and clocks, effectively giving them free advertisements.</li>
<li>By 1895, Coke was sold in every U.S. state and territory. Robinson later focused the messaging on positive associations with the slogan <strong>&quot;delicious and refreshing,&quot;</strong> moving away from the patent medicine angle.</li>
<li>The cocaine content was nearly eliminated by 1905, though the use of decocainized cocoa leaves continued.</li>
</ul>
<h2>II. The Bottling System and Standardization</h2>
<h3>The Perpetual Contract and Scaling (1899)</h3>
<p>In 1899, Candler made what is often called the best and worst deal in business history. He gave two entrepreneurs, Benjamin Thomas and Joseph Whitehead, the exclusive, assignable right to <strong>bottle and sell Coca-Cola</strong> for a token price of $1 and a <strong>perpetual contract</strong> to buy syrup for $1 per gallon (a volume discount).</p>
<ul>
<li>This model allowed the Coca-Cola Company to scale the bottling business <strong>completely capital- and investment-free</strong>, focusing only on syrup production and marketing.</li>
<li>Thomas and Whitehead, as <em>parent bottlers</em>, subcontracted rights to local entrepreneurs, leading to the rapid proliferation of hundreds of local bottling operations.</li>
<li>This structure, known as the <strong>Coca-Cola system</strong>, provided tremendous scale and speed to market, allowing Coke to blanket the U.S. and later the world before competitors. The Coca-Cola Company maintained control over the brand and required bottlers to adhere to strict standards, leveraging their high gross margins against the bottlers&#x27; operational intensity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Protecting the Brand</h3>
<p>The company defended its trademark aggressively against over <strong>7,000 copycat cola brands</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The 1920 Supreme Court ruled that the phrase <strong>&quot;Coca-Cola means a single thing coming from a single source&quot;</strong> and had transcended being merely a descriptive name.</li>
<li>To further distinguish its product, Coke mandated the creation of the <strong>Contour bottle</strong> (or <em>May West bottle</em>), designed to be recognizable &quot;by feel in the dark or lying broken on the ground&quot;.</li>
<li>The contour shape was granted <strong>trademark status in 1951</strong> after a study showed that <strong>99% of Americans</strong> could identify the bottle by shape alone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Woodruff Dynasty and Lifestyle Advertising</h3>
<p>In 1923, <strong>Robert Woodruff</strong> became president, controlling the company for the next 60 years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Woodruff and adman Archie Lee created <strong>lifestyle advertising</strong>, associating Coke not with product features, but with feelings: &quot;happiness, friendship, romance, summer, holidays,&quot; and <strong>America</strong> itself.</li>
<li>Slogans were simplified: <em><strong>Coca-Cola always delightful</strong></em> (1923), <em><strong>Refresh yourself</strong></em> (1924), and the wildly successful <strong>The pause that refreshes</strong> (1929). The latter provided consumers during the Depression with the idea of Coke as an affordable luxury.</li>
<li>The company commissioned artists like Norman Rockwell and Haden Sunblom to create idyllic American scenes.</li>
<li>In 1931, Sunblom created the now-standard <strong>Coca-Cola red, jolly, big Santa Claus</strong>, effectively commercializing and standardizing the modern image of Santa.</li>
<li>Woodruff enforced <strong>standardization</strong> and decreed the formula should not be changed. The physical formula was moved to a bank vault in Atlanta, creating corporate lore around its secrecy.</li>
<li>Woodruff expanded distribution into <strong>gas stations</strong>, installing 32,000 coolers in the first year alone.</li>
</ul>
<h2>III. Competition, World War, and Crisis</h2>
<h3>The First Cola War (Pepsi)</h3>
<p>Coke’s proprietary 6.5-ounce <em>Contour bottle</em> became a vulnerability.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1934, <strong>Pepsi</strong>—which had been bankrupt multiple times—<strong>counterpositioned</strong> Coke by selling 12-ounce servings (in cheap, recycled beer bottles) for a nickel, the same price as Coke. This offered <strong>twice as much cola for the same price</strong>.</li>
<li>Woodruff settled a trademark suit against Pepsi, making it the <strong>only competitor legally allowed to use the word &quot;cola&quot;</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>World War II: Global Expansion</h3>
<p>During WWII, the U.S. military granted Coke employees <em>technical observer status</em>, allowing them to follow troops globally.</p>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. government saw Coke as an <strong>essential morale-builder</strong> for troops and a cultural ambassador.</li>
<li>Woodruff pledged that every American soldier could get a Coke for 5 cents. <strong>64 portable bottling plants</strong> were sent overseas.</li>
<li>This effort distributed over <strong>5 billion bottles</strong> and accelerated Coke&#x27;s international market development by an estimated <strong>25 years</strong>.</li>
<li>By 1950, international operations accounted for a third of profits.</li>
<li><strong>Fanta</strong>, now a Coke brand, originated in Germany during the war as a knockoff drink created by local bottlers who lost access to the original syrup.</li>
<li>The post-war era saw Coke cement its identity as &quot;apple pie in a bottle&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Pepsi Challenge and New Coke (1975–1985)</h3>
<p>Pepsi, under new leadership (Alfred Steel), began attacking Coke by marketing to <strong>Black Americans</strong> (which Coke ignored) and embracing <strong>television</strong> to target the youth (<em>Pepsi Generation</em>).</p>
<ul>
<li>Coke entered a deep, decades-long partnership with <strong>McDonald&#x27;s</strong> (starting 1955), ensuring the highest quality fountain product.</li>
<li>Coke executive <strong>Roberto Goizueta</strong> took over as CEO in 1980. His first major move was replacing U.S. sugar with <strong>high fructose corn syrup</strong>.</li>
<li>In 1982, Coke launched <strong>Diet Coke</strong> (refusing to use the name earlier to protect the main brand). Diet Coke became the number one diet drink in the world.</li>
<li>The <strong>Pepsi Challenge</strong> (1975), orchestrated by Pepsi executive <strong>John Sculley</strong>, used <em>grassroots, reality-style marketing</em> (filmed on home camcorders) to prove that consumers preferred Pepsi&#x27;s taste. Pepsi’s share grew annually for 15 straight years.</li>
<li>In response to declining share, Coke decided to replace the original formula with <strong>New Coke</strong> in 1985. Taste tests showed New Coke beat both Pepsi and Original Coke.</li>
<li>The launch was a <strong>marketing disaster</strong> because Coke failed to test the <em>emotional response</em> to replacing the original product (which represented &quot;America&quot; and &quot;childhood&quot;).</li>
<li>Facing thousands of enraged consumers, Coke retreated after just <strong>79 days</strong>, relaunching the old product as <strong>Coca-Cola Classic</strong>.</li>
<li>The debacle acted as an <strong>accidental publicity stunt</strong>, making consumers realize their intense loyalty, and sales of <em>Coca-Cola Classic</em> surged past previous highs, ending Pepsi’s challenge momentum.</li>
</ul>
<h2>IV. The Total Beverage Company</h2>
<p>Following the New Coke crisis, Warren Buffett’s <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong> purchased a large equity stake when the stock was low.</p>
<ul>
<li>The advertising landscape shifted, and the &quot;one site one sound&quot; strategy failed. <strong>Michael Ovitz&#x27;s CIA</strong> agency took over the ad account in 1992, creating multiple campaigns annually and launching the beloved <strong>Polar Bears</strong>.</li>
<li>Facing a backlash against full-sugar colas due to health concerns and <strong>obesity</strong>, Coke began evolving into a <strong>&quot;total beverage company&quot;</strong>.</li>
<li>The company missed major acquisitions, failing to buy <strong>Frito-Lay</strong> and later losing the $16 billion acquisition of <strong>Quaker Oats (Gatorade)</strong> to Pepsi.</li>
<li>Today, Coke serves <strong>2.2 billion servings</strong> daily and owns 30 brands that generate over $1 billion in revenue.</li>
<li>Coke has 70,000 employees but achieves immense leverage through its system of <strong>700,000 employees</strong> (including bottlers).</li>
<li>Despite diversification, sparkling soft drinks (Coke, Diet Coke, Coke Zero, etc.) still account for <strong>69% of revenue</strong>, and the trademark Coke family makes up 47% of volume.</li>
<li>The core power of the business remains <strong>scale economies</strong>, enabling massive advertising expenditure and low production costs.</li>
<li>The <strong>Coca-Cola system</strong> is defined by Robert Woodruff&#x27;s mantra: <strong>&quot;Everyone who has anything to do with Coca-Cola should make money,&quot;</strong> ensuring all partners (bottlers, retailers, etc.) are incentivized to sell the product.</li>
