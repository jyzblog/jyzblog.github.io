<li><strong>Wafer-level packaging</strong>: Packages the chip before it is cut from the wafer, resulting in a smaller package size.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Chip Modules (MCMs)</strong>: Integrate multiple chips on a single substrate.</li>
<li><strong>System-in-Package (SiPs)</strong>: Integrate chips both horizontally and vertically, offering greater density.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Signal integrity</strong>, which ensures data quality during transmission, is discussed. <strong>The chapter explains the three types of buses used for data transfer</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Control bus</strong>: Carries control signals.</li>
<li><strong>Address bus</strong>: Specifies the memory location being accessed.</li>
<li><strong>Data bus</strong>: Carries the actual data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the chapter discusses <strong>power integrity</strong>, which ensures proper voltage levels throughout the system.</p>
<h3>Chapter 6: Common Circuits and System Components</h3>
<p>This chapter categorizes semiconductor components and dives into their specific functions. It begins by explaining the difference between <strong>digital</strong> and <strong>analog</strong> technology. <strong>Digital signals represent information as discrete values (0s and 1s), while analog signals represent information as continuous values</strong>. The chapter highlights the use of <strong>data converters</strong> to convert between analog and digital signals, enabling real-world interaction with digital systems.</p>
<p>The chapter then uses the <strong>Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) framework</strong> to categorize system components into five segments:</p>
<ol>
